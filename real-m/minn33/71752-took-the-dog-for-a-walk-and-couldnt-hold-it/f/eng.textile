Took the dog for a walk and couldn't hold it

We've had a lot of rain of rain today, and my new puppy has not been a fan of being kept inside. I really needed to pee, but the pup said now is the time to walk, so I obliged. I made it about halfway around the block before I lost complete control and wet myself entirely.

I was so embarrassed when my bladder released as this is not something I typically plan for. I got back, completely soaked, to my husband who is not into my fetish at all. It was his first time seeing me have a genuine accident in our whole time together. He apologized because he didn't know how bad I needed to go and would have taken out puppy if he had known I was desperate.

Now I'm standing in the bathroom not wanting to change out of my wet jeans. I hated losing control, but I love how wet I feel right now.
