When was the last time you peed your pants while stuck in traffic whether its rush hour or construction etc? it happns to me all the time. i cant hold it very long and if im stuck in any kind of traffic its just a matter of time before i wet or even poop my pants. just the other day i got stuck behind a lime of cars waiting for a train it was a long one plus just after is a red light. ended up flooding my pants waiting. another time out of town on vacation with my mom we were stuck in rush hour traffic for over an hour where i wet myself twice once right away already having to go and again as traffic started moving, there was still a 45min drive to hotel and i had to pee again and since i was already wet anyway i just let it go. that time stuck in rush hour mom also had an accident.
