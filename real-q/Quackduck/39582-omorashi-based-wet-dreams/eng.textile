I wasn't sure if this would belong in this category, but I think it seems like it would?

Anyway, I've only ever really had two wet dreams, and they were kind of fleeting. I rarely remember my dreams after I wake up, but I remember some of this one pretty vividly.

It was my ex in my old room, dancing and crossing her legs. She was complaining sometimes, "I really need to use the bathroom." At one point she put her hand over her belly and said "my bladder is really full right now. I really need to pee." (I'm more into desperation than wetting). She went into the bathroom, dropped her pants, and released into the toilet while I watched.

The other one was from a long time ago, so it's abbot fuzzy. It was this girl, who I didn't even really know. She was a friend of a friend, but she was really pretty. She was in her underwear and a bra, doing a pee dance in the bathroom while brushing her teeth. She sometimes held herself and bent her knees. Unfortunately, that's where my dream got really abstract, like they usually do.

What about your wet dreams?
