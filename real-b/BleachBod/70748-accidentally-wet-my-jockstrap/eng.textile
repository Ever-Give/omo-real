Accidentally wet my jockstrap

I’ve been sick for the last few days, which has been a bummer. I tend not to drink enough water in my day-to-day (because I have a weak, unpredictable bladder), but the only thing that’s been making my throat feel better is ice water.

I woke up this morning and went to go about my usual doings (and to throw out all the cough drop wrappers) when I felt a sudden wave of urgency. Like, 0 to 9. I figure, “Eh, it can’t be that bad. Let me just finish what I’m doing and then I’ll go.”

I get hit with a coughing fit, and suddenly I’m realizing that I wet myself a bit. It was just a dime sized patch, and barely noticeable on the jockstrap I was wearing. Still, I was very surprising, and completely unprepared.

It’s a miracle that omo is a turn on, because if it wasn’t, I don’t think I’d be a very happy person.
