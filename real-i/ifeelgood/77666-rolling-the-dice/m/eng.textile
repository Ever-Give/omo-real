A Dice Game Story

Please be warned. Male desperation story ahead. And not only pee desperation. And also not only desperation.

Thought

Okay, so it wasn’t exactly today that I had this idea for the first time. This actually goes back almost two years when I read a certain suggestion for the Kozmo-Lotto VI for the first time. But I never made any specific plans and I was never really sure if I wanted to make a write-up about it or even have a go at it at all. I still am not, so the next addition to this text might be in the far future or never come at all. But let’s get to the point. I like watching omorashi stuff and especially reading stories about holding, desperation, wetting, messing and the pleasure that might come with it. But when it comes to myself, you can count the times I indulged on one hand (except maybe doing little holds). Very few but very fun experiences.

And, naturally, I from time to time fantasize about getting a little adventurous and adding to that number (insert rooky-numbers-meme here :D). So basically, this will be the blueprint of what could become my next omo-experience. The format of a challenge seems quite intriguing because I assume it will be a lot easier for me to commit and stick to the plan that way. Plus stuff like that tickles my competitive side. Plus, what ever happens in that moment, you can always say “Well, it’s part of the game.” or “It’s the rules.” which takes some of the responsibility of of yourself if that makes any sense. The contribution which so heavily inspired my fantasy was written by blUeMana and can be found here:

I suggest you have a quick read for context. It’s funny how the two matters are connected here and yet are to be kept seperate in the end should it come to that point.

Plan

I will not completely stay true to the rule set of the original post and will adjust the following points:

Clothing: … well, I’ll just find pants, t-shirt and underwear which can potentially be sacrificed.

Rule for hitting a ‘2’ with a dice roll: I don’t know about you but I guess if I am at a 9/10, relaxing would immediately end the challenge. Or at least its holding part. And I am not sure how I feel about this. Quick maths: How are the chances? You can only roll a ‘2’ with two D6s by a combination of ‘1’ and ‘1’. So the probability of rolling a ‘2’ is P(2) = P(1) * P(1) = 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36. Consequently, the probability of not rolling a ‘2’ but anything else is 1 – 1/36 = 35/36 if I am correct here. With the given rules I will have to roll the dices every 30 seconds for 20 minutes which gives a total of 40 dice rolls (at max., see doubles-rule). So, the chance that my holding efforts are not abruptly ended by a ‘2’ at any point during the dice-phase are 35/36 to the power of 40. (35/36)40 = 0.324 = 32.4 %. Mmhhhhmhh, yeah. That rule has to go :P. Let’s replace it with the ever most original: Drink a glas of water (150 mL).

As I might lose a few seconds here and there for documentation purposes, I am also contemplating to stay in the dice game part of the challenge not until 20 minutes have passed but until the dices were rolled 40 times. This way, rolling doubles (e.g. 2+2, 3+3, 4+4 etc.) has a much higher effect and would prolong the dice game part to somewhere between 20 and 40 minutes. This one might come back to bite me but let’s see. And the rest stays as it is, I’d say. All set.

Once a good and safe opportunity arises, I will continue here.

Preparation

I got some time for myself and also privacy. This has been on my mind the past days and to be honest I don’t have any excuse to not give it a go today. Right now, I am just drinking water and having some food. I could have easily gone for #2 in the morning and it is 3 pm now. Eventhough this is a really good opportunity for this kind of fun and I have been horny as hell for the past week or so, I am still worried that I might quit before reaching a nine out of ten. Am I really in the mood to go into this challenge? Another question: What is the expected outcome? Well, if you go in at a 9/10 I think this challenge is not winable. But on the other hand, the preferred outcome might also not be ‘win’, but giving a good fight and earning a pleasurable moment. Also, who cares?! LOL.

I did not really prepare in any special way to be honest. I did not eat or drink anything special, just came back from sports and rehydrated. Gotta be pacient. I am already wearing the outfit of choice, blue boxer briefs under blue jeans, basic socks, long sleve t-shirt. Let’s see what happens.

Challenge

Not even 45 mins after writing that ‘preparations’ part above I was having trouble holding my pee. In my fantasy the need to poop had been the dominant one but in reality no, my bladder was causing way bigger problems all of a sudden. I hectically realized that I had to start with the challenge now if I wanted to have a chance at all. Was there any use in starting at all or would it be a lost cause from the start? And hell, was I unprepared. Where was a suitable place at all? The bathroom, my room, elsewhere? What about cleaning up and possibly smell? No time, no time, I just raced to get some D6s and some towels and started in my room with my laptop infront of me to have a stop watch and the rules aka which role means which actions.

For one last time I opened my water bottle and downed a good half a liter. Then I started rolling the dices and followed the respective orders. But only to realize after about five roles, that I needed some system to keep track of the roles a) to know how far I progressed (e.g. how many roles x/40) and b) to know what was going on in hindsight (e.g. which number was rolled and effects on me). Poor man’s excel to the rescue (LO Calc). Accordingly, the very start of the challenge is missing in the documentation but this is basically what happened:

I started in a standing position. Believe me, it was stressful af to have an eye on the time, roll the dices, follow the instructions, make an entry in the table and also, most importantly, concentrate on holding holding holding. At one point very early on I even thought: This is not manageable and wanted to quit and make a dash but I stuck it out (kinda, LOL).

It was only the beginning of the challenge and I was restless. Stepping from foot to foot, squeezing, breathing heavy. I noticed a little spot in my crotch the size of a coin maybe. Could that be? I did not realize that I had lost a drop (probably while squatting, the jeans waistband kind of put a lot of pressure) but when I unzipped, there was no denying. Focus now!

This was when I basically just pissed in my pants. There is honestly no other way to put it. Despite my efford, I was loosing long long spurts. I cleanched in waves and in between: spurt. Spurt. It was a surreal, wild feeling of helplessness. My left leg got some but the right leg got the most of it. I quickly dragged a towel under me with my foot. I went down to my socks . In that moment, I thought: My bladder must be almost empty now, that was so much (LOL, the things you tell yourself). And my mind was already at part two of the challenge: my fate was decided.

My bowels made themselves known more and more here. Letting go right there would have been the easiest thing. But this pressure decreased again. As much as I love rolling sixes and sixes (yeah.. :P) I really enjoyed the next three roles. I rubbed my nipples and got all worked up. Plus I stroked myself through my soaked boxer briefs, clearly dark with pee.

Squatting now was a lot more manageable than with jeans on. Aaaand in came the next six and the next. I tried to keep everything tight but without success. Pee was dripping from my boxers while I was audibly losing a first, a second and a third spurt.

The goal was 40 dice roles but I was not exactly in the most mentally focused condition, so by accident I did 45. There barely were any sixes during the game so luckily I got some on the last two roles. Also double roles for good measure. This was actually perfect. I just let it happen. Despite the towel, my pee was spashing and forming a puddle, rushing out of me, warming my thighs. This was easily more pee than all the previous spurts combined. I was smiling throughout. How bad can you missjudge what drinking a lot in a short amount of time can do to you and how bad can you underestimate some dice game challenge? Well…

Oh dear, off to part 2 of the challenge. This went different than expected in the beginning. I was sitting on the toilet with my peed jeans on and everything and my bowels did not give me any trouble at all. And with the heat of the moment fading away more and more, I realized I could be sitting here for another hour if there is no sudden shift or something like that. And I just decided that this was something for another day.

Afterthought

I am sorry that this de-escalated so hard here. For people who don’t have a thing for messing maybe this is a good thing LOL. I was not sure if I should post, or try another time where I get a better 9/10 starting ground and do a new write-up. But looking at it now, for me it was a fun experience. So here we go. *clicks 'Submit Topic'*
