Today I never realized how truly amazing it feels to release a flood into jeans. I love leggings and I wear them more often, so when I hold until I burst I just do it in my leggings. But today, I had 2 cups of coffee, a green tea and 2 cups of water. I get desperate very fast and I have a very hard time distracting myself from the discomfort once I get to that level of desperation. I could go from slightly squirmy to absolutely bursting in only 20-30 mins depending on what i've drank. It took about an hour or two for all the diuretic liquid to catch up to my bladder, once i did, I helped it speed up with water, and I decided to try wearing Jeans this time. 

Within 20 mins of drinking the water the urge became so unbearable I had to run to the shower so I didn't get any on the floor. I was grabbing myself so tight and shaking every time a wave hit me. Then after fighting like 3 intense waves, the 4th one caused a huge spurt, and it felt too good to stop the flow so I started peeing full force. That first few seconds of warmth you feel pooling up in your undies before the jeans show wet on the outside is just too amazing for words to even describe. Even as the wet spreads down the jeans still feels amazing too. The warmth from your pee holds so much better in jeans. It felt so good I am going to pee the same soaked jeans and undies later once the pee dries up a bit in them
