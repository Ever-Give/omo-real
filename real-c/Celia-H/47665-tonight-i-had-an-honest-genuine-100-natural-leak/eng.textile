Hey all, long-time reader and first time poster checking in. Thought I'd share a recent experience of mine. It's short - I have better stories, which I hope to post very soon.

I'd been pretty aware of my need all evening (I'd had a lot of fluids and was shaking my leg pretty hard to distract myself), but I thought I had time to brush my teeth once I got into a bathroom, even though the association issue of seeing a toilet that nearby and hearing running water might be challenging. So what? I wanted to challenge myself and my weak little bladder. So I got out my toothpaste and toothbrush and turned the sink on. I was tough, right?

Nope. Spurted as soon as the water came on, held myself the whole time, then almost had a full-blown accident just trying to get my panties down to use the toilet that was right next to me. Oops.

This is pretty mild - I could easily be coaxed into sharing some more exciting stories.
