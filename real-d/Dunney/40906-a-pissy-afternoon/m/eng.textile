A pissy afternoon

After a bit of a drought, I'm back in pissy mode. I've done it all afternoon and evening, sending every bladderful down my legs and making sure I had plenty to drink. My shorts are damp. They were clean this morning, and I won't really soak them until Friday. I don't want to do any more laundry than necessary, so I'll keep the smell down for a day or two. If I soak my pants early, by the time 2 or 3 days have passed, even I can't stand the pong, and that means more laundry.
