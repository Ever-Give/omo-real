Last night I challenged myself to a small public wetting at a laundromat (see Amateur Videos in Video Links section) but challenged myself further, in a way that I think would appeal to most everyone on the board. Having toyed with my bladder- letting out little pee streams slowly- I was faced with releasing the flood. As I walked back from the laundromat, I was compelled to release more urine with each step. By the time I arrived to my apartment, I was bursting and had wet one leg of my pants completely, leaving some pee in my left shoe.

Further compounding my desperation was that, even in front of the toilet in the comfort of my own bathroom, I had this to contend with this:

$$:

As I was wearing enclosed boxer briefs (no fly!) I had to completely remove the tape before I could get my pants down. I spurted a little bit as I struggled to break the tape loose, but did myself in when I was removing the final strand; I pulled on the last piece of tape thinking it would come loose, but instead it held fast to the belt, thus pulling the belt even closer to my aching bladder. At this point I had had enough pain and stepped into the shower before releasing a flood into my pants. It was exhilarating!

Give it a shot!
