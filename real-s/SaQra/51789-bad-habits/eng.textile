A while back, I posted about a wetting incident I had while I was playing Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Well... today history repeated itself, and I held for too long with leaky, wet results...

Since i play skyrim on ps4 (downstairs in the living room) i never really wet myself while playing it (even though it can be a fun challenge to pee without anyone noticing). Though it seems to be a great game for desperations.

Since i have a very big bladder i never have problems while gaming... Unless im gaming with friends while secretly wearing pull-ups. Than my pull-up is usually soaked by the time we win as a squad.

I have a slightly small bladder, a-and I probably shouldn't wear light pants like those cargo ones 'cos I have accidents and leaks kinda a lot
