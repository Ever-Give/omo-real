Today I went to my Doctor's office for a physical. As I pulled up to park, I couldn't help but notice, and then couldn't help but laugh. There was a woman around 30 years old crouching in the bushes - helping her 3 year old daughter go pee. Total bummer.

But it didn't end there! As I was up at the counter checking in, a girl of maybe 17 was standing next to me, and the nurse handed her a little plastic jar. I smirked inside, knowing exactly what that was for, but was delighted when she grimaced and rushed off to the bathroom with it. Oh to be so lucky to have been in that bathroom with her; watching as she attempted to spray her full bladder into that tiny opening. She was cute, not really my type, but still cute. Anyways, I was still waiting at the counter while the receptionist was taking a call, when the girl came out and bashfully set her pee sample on the counter for the nurse to take. I tried not to look at her, as I imagined she already felt quite embarrassed, but it did give me a tingling down below when I saw her beautiful pee right before my eyes in such a lucky, lucky jar.

So to add to the list of places to witness pee desperation, I will say that your doctor's office isn't bad !
