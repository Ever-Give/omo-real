Yesterday at my job once again disappointingly the bathrooms were closed due to seasonal renovations, so I guess whenever they do that they just expect everybody to think, too bad I guess there will be no bathrooms, as though it's no big deal, but it's obviously a big deal when you are in the park all day for five or six hours not getting to go to the bathroom.

Like a half hour before we were getting ready to leave the guys wanted to have everybody over to show them something out in the forest, and then the guys made the interesting comment of why are you ladies all sitting leaning against the tree with your legs crossed like that, as they thought it was a rather weird way to be sitting and I eventually said because we have to pee!

I think that in all the time we have been working together this was the first time that this actually came up, but the guys just kind of laughed the whole situation off in the woman sort of just smiled awkwardly sort of rolling our eyes and everything like that, like omg she finally said what we were all thinking.

But then for the next like 20 or 30 minutes we were basically sitting there or standing there leaning with our legs crossed and having a conversation with the guys who were standing up not leaning against anything and looking a lot more comfortable. Throughout the rest of the conversation no one mentioned my comment about how we have to pee ever again, but it seemed like the guys were smiling, so I couldn't help but think that they were finding the whole situation amusing.

Again I felt like bring up more of the conversation and be going on about how we have been holding it pretty much the entire work year and everything like that, and get into this whole big thing like I would if I were chatting here, but then I guess I felt too awkward, so then we just sort of quietly stood there with our legs crossed until it was time to get back and leave and everything, but never again did we mention the fact that we had to pee.

But it felt kind of weird to actually admit that and everything, and everybody seemed to think it was rather funny, but I don't know if the guys realize just how uncomfortable we were most of the day all of the time. I think when you don't realize that it's really easy to just laugh it off, but I knew that the other women on the crew were probably thinking this is just ridiculous that we were standing there with our bladders full and our legs crossed, while the guys were standing across from us standing there comfortably and looking relieved as we know that they had regularly relieve themselves during the day.

But again we didn't really talk about it any further, and it felt awkward to try and prolong the conversation, because I didn't want to look strange. It is one thing talking about this in a community like this, but talking about with your coworkers can make things weird, but that was the first time we actually acknowledged the bathroom situation and I just thought it was interesting and worth a mention.
