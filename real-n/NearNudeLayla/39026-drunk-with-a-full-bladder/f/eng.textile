Over the past 2 hours, I've been drinking rum and coke with ice to fill my bladder. Over time my bladder's been filling a lot, especially in the past 30 minutes. I was at a point where I thought I was going to pee myself, but now I'm a little more content, probably because I have been sitting still. I can keep this forum updated on what happens from here on out. If anyone posts here before my impending accident, you may suggest something (within reason) I could do to make myself more or less comfortable. ;)

When my accident happens, I'll post about it. I may even post about my pee breaks afterwards too.

Update: I decided to stand up and my bladder hurts quite a bit. I can still hold it, but not much longer. I also want to pee outside tonight too if possible. Also, I am wearing a skirt.

Oh! I did not know there was such a thread. Thank you. I'll repost it there.
