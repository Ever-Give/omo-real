Wee on the carpet at home

Here is a frontal view of me kneeling in the nude and urinating on the carpet just after I woke up this morning. Due to there being NO TOILET in my apartment, the carpet often has to double up as a makeshift urinal when I need to empty my bladder.

Very nice! Love the convenience of just rolling out of bed and urinating immediately.

I'm not into poop at all, but I have to wonder – in an apartment with no toilets, you can pee in so many ways. But where do you poop?

I am not into messing either but when I do need to poop in my apartment without a toilet it means squatting over some newspaper or a plastic bag and disposing of in the household waste. I usually do this in the bathroom, in the space where the toilet is supposed to be!

I don't know the full contractual rights or wrongs as it is my parents apartment they hold the lease.

However my apartment is the top floor conversion of a two storey house which has two bathrooms but crucially the only toilet is downstairs therefore the building has a toilet but since the conversion, upstairs cannot access it! Hence the reason why I have to improvise and use whatever I can as a toilet!
