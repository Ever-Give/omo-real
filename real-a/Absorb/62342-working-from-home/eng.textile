Usually this year, like so many others on the planet I have been working from my home.

A few days ago I was talking to a client on the phone and I had to go to the point I could not sit still.

I was walking around, and just about to ask if I could call back, when I realized that noone could see me.

So basicallt rigt then, in that moment, I just let it out in my pants while the conversation went on.

The amount of liquid that came out of me was enough to surprise even a seasoned wetter like me.

My first reaction was to jump into the bathroom, which I was close to, but for some reason i thought that the person at the other end would hear that, and the floor where i was standing could take it, so instead (still for some unknown reason) i decided to sit down instead.

It was trying to maintain focus on the dialogue while in the same time having the warm stream pouring out of me.

Especially as the warm puddle was spreading around me.

At one point i was asked if something was wrong, which i truthfully declared it wasn't.

The call went on for maybe two more minutes before i could get up and start cleaning up.

The feeling of wetting while mainly concentrating on something else was really special.

Maybe something in the line of holding/peeing while gaming which semms fairly common.

I might try that too.
