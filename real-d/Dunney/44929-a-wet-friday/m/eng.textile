I'm pissy today. More than usual. I had a dry night, which was just as well because I had visitors at a time when I would have been in bed, sodden with piss and stinking, had I wet my bed. I'd pissed myself before my morning shower, but it had all washed off of course. The visit was short, I did some visiting of my own, got back home and wet my pants. I kept them on, drank some water, drank some coffee, read the paper while my bladder refilled. I wet again, pooped my pants, dealt with the mess and put my wet pants back on. The poopy underpants got rinsed and put back on as well. They were wet anyway, so I didn't worry about drying them. I've pissed several time since. I'm keeping my fluid intake high because I want to be wet all day. My pants are wet as I type this, and I'm going to keep them that way.
