So something happened a few months ago i was sleeping and i distinctly remember the dream I had i was being chased by something that i never got a good look at and i had locked myself in a room and it was banging on the door repeatedly and i wet my self in fear and ran away it went on for a little and when I woke up i was in a wet bed has something like this happened to anyone else?
