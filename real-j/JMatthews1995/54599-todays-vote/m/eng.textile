So today was an interesting one. As most of you know, the UK is having it's general election. I decided today would be a full risky vote. I peed through my boxer briefs, put on some super dark jeans, put on a long coat and headed out to vote.

It was so thrilling to go in and stand there doing such an important and grown up thing having soaked my boxers just 15 minutes before!

Since then I have let them dry and rewet whilst I have been at home!

Great Fun!!
