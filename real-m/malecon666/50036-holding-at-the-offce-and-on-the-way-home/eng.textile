Today at the office, I decided to hold all the piss in, while still drinking one large glass of water every 1 h. if the pressure gets too strong, I just go to the toilet and relieve a little bit, without fully undressing. I wear some dark pants so nobody will notice (altough the smell does get through a bit).

Currently it's 19:30, and I am still holding, and drinking some more beer. The pictures show my "progress" - enjoy Currently I'm at 9/10 again, bladder bulge clearly visible...

15.00 at the office - 4 out of 10 - relieving some pressure:

16.00 at the office - 5 out of 10:

16.00 at the office - stuffing it all back in so nobody notices

17.00 leaving office - 6 out of 10 - relieving some more pressure:

18.00 at the shopping centre - 7.5 out of 10 (had a beer in between)

18.00 at the shopping centre - 7.5 out of 10 - piss flows out

18.30 at the pub - 8.5 out of 10 - clearly visible patch, while having another beer

19.15 - finally home - 9 out of 10

As fun as it may be, at least in my opinion something like wetting yourself while working isn't something you should usually do. You're subjecting others to something they might not care for plus not to mention it can be a sanitation issue too (if it's say like a desk job, shared cubical and seating area).

Don't worry I am very careful when wetting at work, I only let out little spurts and wear clothes which will cover small "accidents". The only real problem is that, after a while, it begins to smell a bit. That's why I only do it when there are only few other people around, and I have no meetings for the rest of the day.
