Kind of embarrassing and unplanned, but I don't have anywhere else to put this so....

I'm a trans man & still live at home with my parents. We only have 1 bathroom & my mom was taking a shower. I felt like I hadn't drank a whole lot - a 12oz root beer & unknown amount of water - probs btwn like 10-20oz? earlier today i had a mug of coffee & a 16oz iced tea but had used the bathroom since then.

I was just laying out on the couch trying to take a short nap but out of nowhere got hit with Bladder Need. it didnt seem too bad but I'm wearing a pair of tight jeans so the waistband was putting a lot of pressure on it. I was dozing a bit so I figured I could wait....but already I was starting to dream of peeing, just nonstop and I could feel it at the edge of my urethra when I started awake again.

I have an old 1L water bottle in my room that I dont use to drink from anymore so I hid in my room & peed into it....it has a large opening so I just propped it on some dirty towels & aligned myself with it so i didnt spill very much. i filled it about halfway so im guessing around 500mL. It was surprising since I don't usually go from unnoticeable to Very Urgent like that, but it was fun to be a bit Naughty as I don't get a lot of chances to indulge in this kink myself :3c
