I've recently started experimenting with peeing on myself. At first I thought I would probably not like it too much and I was just curious. So this morning I drank a lot of tea and when my bladder got decently full, I jumped into the bathtub, naked. I lay down on my back, lifted my pelvis, "aimed" at myself, let the sphincter muscles put up some pressure and let it go. When the first spurts hit my body and my face, I was pleasantly surprised. I really liked the feeling of warm wetness, even knowing it was my own pee. I did like the faint smell and the light salty taste in my mouth (since I had drunk a lot of tea in a short amount of time, the smell and taste weren't too strong). After releasing a few spurts first, I got brave and finally released most of the contents of my bladder in a long go. It really was a pleasant experience and I'll surely repeat it in the future.

So now I'm curious - do you pee on yourself, do you like the experience? Any ideas for future "experiments"? I will surely try to do a self-pee wetting at some points, but maybe some of you have any other ideas...
