So basically I woke up yesterday and told myself i was going to hold for 24 hours. I woke up at 6am so i was going to hold until 6am tomorrow.

I woke up and felt no urge to pee. I walked downstairs and did the usual, had breakfast etc. by lunch, I needed to pee but not really. It was like a four. I was going for a walk in the park around 3pm and I was at a 7 now. I was squirming a bit. I decided to wear black shorts just in case lol. So I was walking and it suddenly shot up to a 9. I squirted a little, and had trouble stopping the flow. A man saw me but I think he didn’t feel like confronting me. I knew I couldn’t hold it much longer. I reached in to my back pack because I was going to grab a towel, sit on it and slowly pee as to not raise suspicion. But when I turned, the waistline on my shorts tightened and that was too much for my bladder. I just started full on peeing on my walk
