I want to try having a real accident outdoors today, and I’m fairly confident I will not see anyone out. I’ll start my rapid desperation set-up at noon today- (Time of posting is 7:33am for reference) peeing freely and drinking water (a lot; haven't determined) every hour.

My hike will be at 5pm, I’ll be going somewhere remote to respect social distancing, and other’s privacy, and then I think I’ll bring tea with me, drinking every 15 minutes. I’ll update this thread and tell you how it goes! I’d like outfit recommendations. It should be sunny and 50 degrees (F)

I’m looking forward to it!!!

It won’t get dark for awhile. It shouldn’t get dark until 7 or 8 now. You make a good point- should I have an accident on the trail or trying to get home? I think it would be more thrilling to do a barely-made-it by trying to get home.

Trial on the rail?

I’m currently at only a 7/10 but I’ve been holding for 4 hours after trying the rapid desp. method. Maybe I did it wrong? Dunno. I do have to go but my bladder is made of steel I guess. I think I’ll actually make it home and to the toilet. Thats after a hike and a long drive on a very pot-holed bumpy dirt road.
