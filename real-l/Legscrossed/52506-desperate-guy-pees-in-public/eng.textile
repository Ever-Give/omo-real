As I waited for my ride the other day, I saw a desperate guy releiving himself. He looked to be in his early 20s. A car pulled over across the street from where I was, and he practically bolted out of there. He searched (unsucessfully) for a secluded place to pee. This was by the bus station and there were people nearby. He was too desperate to wait any longer, but also too shy to just go for it and pee. It was cute to watch him squirm. Finally his friend came over to give the poor guy partial cover so he could piss behind a lamp post. He stood peeing for at least a good 30 seconds, so he must have been holding a very full bladder.
