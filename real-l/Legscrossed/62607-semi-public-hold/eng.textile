I usually don't hold in public, but today i was running late and had a lot of errands to run downtown. I left the house with an already full bladder. I had been holding my pee for an hour already when i went out. I know i can hold it for a long time so i wasn't worried. Anyway, i was distracted by some errands i had to run. On the ride home i was beginning to grow desperate. I was holding for 2 hours and i had to go really bad. When i got home, i had a large iced coffee and a bottle of water. By sheer will power, i held my pee for another hour and a half after getting home. Almost 4 hours of holding. I waited until the last possible moment and finally relieved my bladder. My bladder was so full that it felt like i couldn't pee fast enough to feel relief. I only felt a sense of relief when i had completely emptied my bladder. I peed for just over a minute.

Sounds like you have a huge capacity. Have you ever measured?

Haven't measured recently.

A while ago i peed 1.5 liters minus the wet spot on my pants.
