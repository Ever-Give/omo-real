So here's how this happened again. This time it wasn't because I was embarrassed to ask to use bathroom. I was sitting around in English class bored with ten minutes till gym class. I was perfectly fine, didn't have to pee at all till suddenly my bladder came so close to bursting, out of no where I was barely keeping the urine from bursting into my khaki shorts. I had my legs twisted so tight that it hurt and I felt the tiniest bit drip out and finally as the bell ran another drop slipped out but suddenly as I stood up the urge was gone and I just continued on to gym. Stupid idea. I jogged over to the locker room switched into my gym clothes and sat in the gymnasium.

I sat down and suddenly boom I spurted a large amount of urine into my gym shorts and I jumped slightly and felt the urge return and I spent the rest of gym losing the feeling then suddenly wetting a little to the point I just pulled my shorts over my gym shorts so they couldn't see what my underwear would look like and if I peed more it would go through the gym shorts before anything. I did pee continuously through school but it never soaked through (you also couldn't see the wet spot on the gym shorts do to the fabric)
