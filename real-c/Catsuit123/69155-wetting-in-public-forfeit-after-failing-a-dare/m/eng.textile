I used to participate in various dares within a group, I loved pushing boundaries. I had a dare set for me.

This was a few years back - I was dared to go into a dance shop wearing some old clothes and trainers I could lose, take a pair of ballet flats with me, wear nude tights under clothes, buy a skirted leotard, (ring first to check in stock, pay over phone if possible, which it was) , ask to try it on, get assistant to take photo, then leave my clothes in changing room and leave shop and return to car in car park just wearing the leotard tights and Ballet flats. I went into shop, collected leotard, but there was kid in shop with mum, so didn't go through with dare, just collected leotard and left. As a result I had to do a forfeit.

This was forfeit - wearing white catsuit under t shirt and jogging bottoms. drink plenty of water, then park up near public toilets with a trough urinal, keep drinking water to point of desperation.

Once bladder completely full, make the short drive to toilets, park up, take off trainers, walk into the public toilets bare foot, strip in cubicle to just the catsuit, then stand in the urinal to relieve myself. I had to video as evidence I had carried it out.
