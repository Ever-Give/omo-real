Early morning desperation

I woke up one morning with a desperate need to pee but it wasn't as simple as just dashing to the loo as my apartment does NOT have a toilet installed.

As I was in the nude, I had no trousers on to wet myself and thus quickly looked round my room for anything that I could use to relieve myself. Luckily the water bottle beside my bed only had a couple of mouthfuls left so I drank the remaining contents and promptly filled it again with the contents of my bladder.

As you can see, the bottle was only just about big enough!
