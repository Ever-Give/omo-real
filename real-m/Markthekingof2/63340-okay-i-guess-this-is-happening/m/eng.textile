Last couple of days have been weird. I'm not sure if its stress or if or if there's something wrong with my bladder, but I wet the bed the past two nights in a row (last night was my fault. I had tea after dinner at like five thirty or six), but the night before I took all precautions I normally take, and it still happened. I'm like wtf but not upset or anything. I'm more curious and slightly annoyed than anything.

Then today, I was on my way back from the store and got a really sudden intense urge to go, but then it went away and I didn't feel it anymore. When I got home, the urge hit so bad I started going in my pants almost immediately. Then, more recently, I was sitting on my chair watching tv, then same thing: super intense urge that basically pushed out everything into my clothes. That time it wasn't a huge amount. It really only got on my clothes so that wasnt too bad. But damn, I'm sitting here thinking "hmm...I wonder what's going on." I'm not super worried yet because there is a lot of stress in my life right now, and I've been drinking a lot more caffeine due to not sleeping great. When I do sleep, I pee so that's wonderful lol If it gets too bad, I might need diapers. Not looking forward to wearing at work tho...
