I got home from school after holding for hours, I had not peed since 3 am And it was now 4pm. My bladder hurt so bad. My mom told me to go do my homework and i told her i needed the rest room. I could not hold it! She still told me to go to my room. So as i was told i went to my room and started my homework. I felt the first few drops and i started to panic taking my pants of quick! I looked around for a towel or something but there was nothing. I grabbed myself hoping foot to foot.I started crying from the pain. My whole bladder was swolen. I drank to much.. I tried to hold it bouncing foot to foot. Then a spurt came, Long warm so soft, Filling my underwear. I tried to stop it. Then another long long spurt... I gave up. I fell on the floor peeing on my hands, feet and underwear. MY mom came in and saw the puddle. She punished me and made me hold it again
