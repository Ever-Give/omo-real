Casually just letting it go

So early tonight, I started an omorashi escape room challenge. Because of it I drank a lot of water, but I failed the challenge and I didn’t need to go enough to piss myself. So I went about my day.

I always appreciate calm and serene environments. So, I always take advantage of snow storms and blizzards, since I can go on walks alone at night with little to no interruptions. So about an hour ago I left to go on a walk to my local cemetery about a half mile away.

For the entirety of the walk I felt my bladder calling to me a bit, but I was in public, even if no one would see me. So I kept it in.

Following my snowy walk, I came back up to my house and layed in the snow outside. I noticed that my bladder was yelling for me to give in, so I let my bladder loose and let all my warm yellow urine stream out my dick. It felt *so* good, three of the layers I had on were completely drenched in my piss and smelled great.

I always love being able to just let go, a lot of the omorashi I do feels performative, and more like a set of steps. But sometimes just pissing yourself when you have a full bladder is a shit load of fun.
