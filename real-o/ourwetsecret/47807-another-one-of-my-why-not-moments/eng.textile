Another one of my "why not?" moments

So this is kind of straight to the point and there wasn't any prep or much story to my choices...

I've been very busy these past few days and tonight I decided to help my mom with wrapping some last-minute gifts. I'm not the best at wrapping (I'm a gift bag and tissue type of person) so it took me a minute to get the hang of it. I felt the need to go to the bathroom, which I felt was a bit odd because I had just went about an hour prior and I only drank one bottle of water. I've been doing holds for the past few nights but haven't wet because I wasn't really in the mood, and my bladder has been pretty normal so I didn't expect there to be an urge to go so soon. After wrapping about 4 boxes, I bent down and I really started to feel the need to go and I actually leaked a bit in my underwear which was SUPER odd because I know I didn't drink that much.

In a spur of the moment decision [like 98% of my wettings are], I grabbed a dirty towel out of my hamper, placed it on my carpet, and allowed my bladder to let go. In my opinion, it felt great buttttt I was barely holding much liquids for my bladder to be that needy. It might be shrinking at this point, I really don't know.
