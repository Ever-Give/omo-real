Ill have to admit im completely new to the way this site works, i dont know if this is what you click on to create a post but ill get to my experience.

It occured last week when i was doing an art project and had downed several cups of tea and a litre of water, after i had gotten on the bus i felt a sharp pain in my bladder that hit me by surprise (i have a bad habit of ignoring or not recognising when i need to pee till its bad) and i knew the ride back to my appartment by bus was 10 minutes and the walk to the actual appartment another 15 because the bus stop is very far away. Luckily my girlfriend was here today (she loves pee play almost as much as me) to wittness all this but at the tume much to my dismay decided to tease me and poke at my bladder saying things like

"awww are you going to wet yourself? Go on baby i wanna watch"

- or "if you wet yourself ill punish you"

Which ill admit was incredibly hot but not much helping my situation.

By the time we had reached the bus stop i was practically wadling and in a lot of pain. Unluckily (or luckily) my girlfriend emily desided to jump on be back and surprise me making me leak a little. I was practically crawling at this point and emily, to say sorry and get home faster let me have a ride on her back and i really thought i could make it, we were about 10 yards away from my appartment door when the pee began rushing out of me and down my legs and the back of emilys neck.

Lets just say i was punished rather severly ;)
