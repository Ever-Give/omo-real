So a few years ago a friend of mine natural bed wetting would be fun but she didn’t want it to be permanent so somehow she figured out a way to do it practically whenever you want anyways i was talking to her and it somehow comes up in conversation so i asked how she did it and she sent me the steps so i decided to share them on here

1. First this will probably take a few days but just go through the day but don’t drink anything for about three hours before bed and go to the bathroom as much as you like

2. Pick some clothes she did it with both a certain pair of panties and diapers make sure it is something with a distinctive feeling (avoid things that you wear often or during the day (she tried this same thing while she was awake but she wanted to only mess herself when wearing a this pair of panties and and after about a month she did it a fun trick when lying about the house but not so fun when she wore some similar panties and shit herself in public)

3. Right before you go to bed Drink about 2.5 (adjust for bladder capacity) cups of preferably warm water or some other drink and go to sleep in your choice of outfit

4.you will likely wake up in the night to pee don’t move and wet as much as possible before going back to sleep without changing

5.Depending on how many times you do this kinda thing it could take more time but it takes about a week on average

It works because the human body creates an association between your choice of clothing and being able to wet freely and the more times you do this the stronger the association gets but you have to do this about once a month to keep the association this can be done when awake but i don’t recommend it as it can lead to embarrassing situations

Anyways tell me how it goes or if you find a way to improve it
