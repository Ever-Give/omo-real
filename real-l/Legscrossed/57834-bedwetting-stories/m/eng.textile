This didn't happen very often, but I wet my bed ocassionaly when I was small. I didn't like getting out of bed to go to the toilet, so I would hold it and go back to sleep. I could barely make it to the toilet when I woke up, often with a pee stain on the front of my pjs. Occasionally, this resulted in me peeing the bed. I hated it but was too stubborn to get up for a night time pee. It stoppening when I went to school, but happened again when I was 10, which is too old to pee the bed.

I woke up in the night needing to pee pretty bad, but didn't want to get out of bed, so I went back to sleep. Early the next morning, I woke up in the middle of wetting the bed. I tried to stop, but my bladder had burst and I couldn't hold it in anymore. I soaked my pjs, the sheets, and the blanket.

I was so embarrased that I ran to the shower crying. In the shower, the running water made me want to pee again and I wet in the shower as well. When I came out no one mentioned it.
