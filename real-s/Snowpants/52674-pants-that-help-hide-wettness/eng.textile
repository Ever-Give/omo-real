One goal of mine is to try and find pants that help hide wetness so I can wet myself in public settings. Snowpants work perfectly for me in the winter. Warmer weather is more difficult. I went out for a walk this morning wearing a new pair of black nylon pants. WOW did they work great for me. I did not flood them but as my bladder could not take the pressure it kept leaking so this wetting was fairly slow. What a great feeling to be out in public, wetting my pants, and no one knowing what I was doing. Here are some pics when I got back home.

. Thanks for the suggestion. I like both hiding and showing my wetness in public. I expected these pants to show something but nothing showed. I have the same pair in a medium grey color. I will have to try those to see if the wetness shows. Good to know either way so I can plan a showing, or not, ahead of time.

I recently purchased some rain pants to wear when I walk to and from work in the rain. I have wet while wearing them once and can't wait to do it again soon.
