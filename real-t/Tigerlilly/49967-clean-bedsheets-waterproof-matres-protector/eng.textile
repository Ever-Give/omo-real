Hi.. so today I bought a new pillow and mattress protector because my old ones needed replacing, but this time I bought a waterproof mattress protector.

I put them on when I got home and changed the sheets. I don't know about you, but for some reason clean sheets are the ones that I want to let loose on the most. Usually I restrain myself because cleaning my sheets and mattress without my parents knowing anything too much is hard. Today though, I thought I'd test out my new mattress protector. It's cheap but it worked wonders!!! Not a single damp spot! I'm very happy with it

I have a tip -layering when making the bed hehe. Sheet then matress protector then another sheer and mattress protector and a final sheet on top. Just peel off the wet layers and keep going haha. Specially handy for middle of the night bedding changes

Interesting thought! I don’t wet too often but maybe i’ll try this one time

Good pictures. That would be a problem with the PeePodMats. They don't show wet anywhere near that clearly. But I love everything else about them.

The one problem with these is that because the mattress protector doesn’t absorb the stain, just stops it from going through, that it spreads really far! That pee was all of about four seconds. I can’t imagine what a full, bladder emptying would be like. Plus it gets cold quickly
