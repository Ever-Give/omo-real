Last night my shower clogged so scheduled a plumber with my 24/7 emergency landlord, he told me they'd be in the morning. Set my alarm and proceeded to do my normal ritual of getting drunk and playing video games. Like i normally do, i drank a bunch of water before bed so i didn't have too much of a hangover.

Waking up that morning to someone knocking on my door, and an absolutely agonizingly filled bladder. I quickly jumped out of bed, dancing from the discomfort of the weight of my bladder, and waddled to see who it was. Great it was the plumber, and i realized then that my apartment only had one bathroom. I showed him to the bathroom and he began to work while i crossed my legs on the couch trying everything not to flood my sweatpants. The urges of beer and water from all through the night banging on my bladder walls was causing some major anxiety.

I answered his questions over the course of the next hour, every minute the seal was breaking little by little.
