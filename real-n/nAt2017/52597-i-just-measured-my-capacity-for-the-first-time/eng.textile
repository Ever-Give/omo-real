I just measured my capacity for the first time!

I'm so embarrassed right now, but also a little proud of myself... I bought a measuring cup today and measured the amount of pee I was holding! The cup could only hold 500 mL, so I had to stop midstream, empty the liquid into a lemonade bottle, then start again... which means that I lost a significant amount of volume into a towel in between, lol. The first batch was 500 mL, and the second was about 200... so I'm guessing my capacity is at least 700 mL! Obviously there's no way of measuring how much more I leaked into my pants before managing to pull them down, nor the significant volume that's currently soaking my bathrobe.

I'm surprised, because I thought I had a really small bladder (400 mL max).

Anyway, here's a pic of how much I managed to get into the lemonade bottle! There's still some left in the measuring cup. I'm a 5-foot-tall girl who has to pee constantly, so I'm pretty pleased with myself

Do you sometimes pee outdoors or do you always wait until you reach a proper toilet?

I always wait for a toilet! Well, except for this time, I suppose...
