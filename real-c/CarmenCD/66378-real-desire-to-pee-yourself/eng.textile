How many of you sometimes experience real desire to pee yourself when you feel the need to pee? I mean strong irresistible desire, you just have to do it. It happens to me from time to time and if the place is right, I do it. But today I just couldn't resist and done it while waiting for a bus on the way home. I just had to let go a little in my panties, no matter the risk. I managed to control my bladder enough to only get wet between my legs, no really visible wetness, but there was no guarantee I won't lose it and wet myself in the middle of town in rush hour. I was not so desperate I wouldn't be able to hold it, it was not peeing from necessity.

Anyone else has similar experience?

I’ve let some squirts go in my pants, just enough to get that sexy wet and warm feeling.

Exactly. Doing it when among people is even more sexy and naughty, because you never know if you will let out a bit too much and other might notice that tell-tale wet patch.
