Lost it at the Last Second

So I held a couple times today till my bladder muscles were tired, then the last desperation ended pretty well. I turned on my camera and tried making a run for it at the last minute, but as soon as I reached the toilet to unzip my pants it all just started coming out. I knew I was one second away from an accident, so I had to hobble into to the shower to avoid a mess, still desperately trying to hold back the flow, but lost total control before I could even get my other leg in. I was paralyzed in position peeing full force cause it just felt too good to even move. Still ended up peeing allover my floor anyway as you can see. Now I am sitting in my room with my wet jeans waiting to re-wet them with more warm lovely liquid
