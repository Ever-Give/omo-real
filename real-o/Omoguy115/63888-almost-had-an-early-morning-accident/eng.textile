Ok so this is a short story thats happen a couple weeks ago. So one morning I woke up and like every morning I had to take my morning pee but this one was different usually when I get up i pick up my phone and put off my morning pee for at least 10mins once I'm free for the day. But as soon as I grabed my phone my bladder made itself known so I got up and made my way to the bathroom letting out a leak.

When I got to the door it was locked someone was using the toilet so I went back to my room. I close the door behind me and instantly started peeing dancing holding on for dear life and thinking I would pee myself. I sat down on my bed and turned on my phone trying to get my mind off the fact I was about to burst. It was soon clear that I wouldn't be able to hold even another minute i got out of bed and out my room looked towards the bathroom to still see the door closed and i didn't even see if anyone was inside I went straight out into the back yard went behind a tree leaking so much before I could pull it out to pee.
