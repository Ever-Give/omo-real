We finally made it through another hot dry summer. I hope I am not the only one looking forward to a cold wet winter. I pulled out my insulated nylon winter gear this past weekend and can't wait to wear it outside in the cold and wet myself. The thick nylon clothing is perfect for fun and discreet public wetting. I am planning wetting while shoveling, walking the neighborhood, shopping and just doing anything with my snowsuit on.

Anyone else out there performing the same prep work?

So true. It sounds like you speak from experience. Care to share?

. I hope you enjoy wetting your snowsuits as much as I do. Pissing yourself in public with no one knowing what you are up to can be very exciting.

My favorite experience is getting up with a full bladder, dressing in layers then adding a nice thick snowsuit on top. I head out in the cold to see how long I have until I start wetting myself. I will do anything from shoveling snow to just walking around the neighborhood. It is really great if someone stops me to chat. I try not to show how desperate I am while standing there. I have been known to start leaking into my snowsuit right in front of that person. It feels so great inside the snowsuit and to know what I am getting away with.
