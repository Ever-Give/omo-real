No other option but to pee my pants

So this occurred about fourteen years ago, when I was about five. I was still diapered back then, even thought I had been potty trained for about two years at that point, give or take. I did occasionally use the bathroom, but only after I had gotten used to that place. Now this occurred within my first week at my preschool at the YMCA. I had run out of diapers so I went commando under my sweatpants. After an hour of playtime, I felt a growing pressure in my bladder and bowels. My two bottles of milk, my breakfast, and my snack time food and juice seemed to want out of me. 

I had a rough idea of where the bathrooms were, but was still uncomfortable with using them. I shuffled away from where I was playing, and looked for a quiet spot to fill my pants. My pants were a dark blue color, and the carpeted floor a dark green. I eventually hunkered down behind a bookcase, and just let go. A small mound of poo swiftly entered the back of my pants, while a stream of pee flowed to the crotch of my pants, and down my legs. After I was sure my pants were dry enough, I made my way into the bathroom, and dumped the poop into the toilet.
