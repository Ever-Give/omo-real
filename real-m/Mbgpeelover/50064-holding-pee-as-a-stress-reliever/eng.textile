Hi, I haven’t been on here much as real life has been exceedingly stressful. One way I cope with stress though is that I drink more and pee less as I find the feeling of holding a very full bladder very enjoyable. Does anyone else find holding pee a good way of helping with stress? Maybe it’s the distraction, or the lovely tingling feeling or what I don’t know but it definitely helps.

Anyone else?
