I woke up about twenty minutes ago and I had to pee really badly. I decided to hold because my bladder was full to the point it hurts. I rolled out of bed and put on a depends. I started doing the pee dance while I hobbled to the kitchen for some water. While pouring the water I had to let a little bit out. My piss came jetting out into my diaper for 3 seconds. I felt some relief but my bladder still aches. However I stopped the pee dancing and was able to hold better. The front of my depends was nice and warm with my pee. Now I’m sitting outside, waiting for the next wave of desperation to hit. I can feel it building. My bladder wants to relieve itself of it’s contents but I’m holding for just a bit longer.

Well the second wave came and I gave in. There was so much pee! The diaper over flowed and I had pee running down my legs! It was delicious. Now it’s time to go to work. What a way to start the day!!!
