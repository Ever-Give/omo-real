Occasionally,one may find a picture of a certain model[x] opening her legs widely while standing ,raising her skirt and showing her panties while peeing through them.Under the photo ,a title is presented as that:[[x] had an accident in her panties].In fact,this has nothing to do with accidents,it is a mere professionally planned wetting.In my opinion,a wetting can only be termed an accident if it fulfils the following:

1.It happens without the desire of the girl who wets,she may try in despair and in vein to prevent it with all her will and power,but finally fail and give in

2.Because of the aformentioned fact,a girl in such a situation does not open her legs while peeing but either keeps her legs tightly closed together or keep them crossed.This behaviour is a mere reflex action,she hopes to minimize the extent of her wetting and the size of the puddle as much as possible

3.As a result,girls who suffer a real accident usually have their legs and shoes and maybe the front of their skirts completely drenched..If sitting,the back of their skirt would be drippling wet,so will be the inside part of their thighs,knees and heels due to her keeping her legs tight together while wetting herself sitting

4.A girl may open her legs apart or raise her skirt or examine her wet panties,but all these acts happen only after some time elapsing.This is when the initial shock of wetting herself as an adult have somewhat subdued

5.Am i right or wrong in all what i said?Most photos and clips featuring what they call [real accidents] cannot be convincing,thes are well done professionally staged planned accidents. Any planned wetting must apear real to acheive its goal,real wettings of natural causes must happen without the will of the wetter,she tries to minimize the extent of wetting by keeping her legs tight or crossing them.As a result of keeping legs tight,they become drenched with pee when wetting occurs.What i was criticizing was the appearance of models peeing their panties while keeping their legs widely apart.This does not happen at all in nature[ except if the model was very keen not to get pee on her legs and by doing so,she proves she is not into wetting and so has minimum effect on us who enjoy peeing ourselves down our legs

I may also add that witnessing a real accident is quite a very rare event.Beyond elementary school years,one may not witness an adult[ who is neither sick nor drunk] have an accident for many many years .Exceptions are those people working in geriatric institutions or as school teachers in elementary schools.These may witness a handful of accidents annually.However,these types of real accidents may not be turn ons
