I have a small bladder I usually have to pee like 20 times a day and some times I cant make it to the bathroom, but I haven't wet the bed since I was 13 and im 29 now. I usually go to the bathroom before I go to sleep, but last night I was so tired I went straight to bed. When I was sleeping, I felt a warm water flow in my pants and it woke me up. Thats when I realized I was peeing my pants in bed. I didnt even try to stop it I just the pee come out into the bed, I liked the feeling. Have any of you wet the bed as an adult?
