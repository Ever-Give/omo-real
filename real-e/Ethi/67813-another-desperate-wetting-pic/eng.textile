Just another quick post! Had to go pretty badly for the last few hours and decided to just finally let go, just stood up and let it all out!

One of these days I swear ill be confident enough to post a video, maybe for a special occasion?$$

The wetter, the better. always love to watch it happen, but even better to watch it happen a second time in the already wet ones!

I never wet twice but i love to look down and see the wetness spread throughout the fabric!
