I've always wanted to go to bed dry and wake up wet. I didn't think it would ever happen, but for it to happen I knew I would have to get a bit drunk and be a little desperate when I went to bed, but not so desperate that I couldn't sleep. I got a littl drunk last night and had to go a bit when I went to bed. I woke up and my mouth was really dry so I got a drink of water. I had put a diaper on, since I didn't want to get the bed wet. I got back in bed and could feel that I had to pee some, but didn't feel that desperate. 

Before I want back to sleep I actually leaked a little. Surprised me. Unfortunately the diapers work great when you are standing, but not so great when you are laying down, the diaper got a little wet outside of the absorbent area. An hour or so later I woke up again and got another drink. When I got back in bed I had another leak. Got everything a little wetter than I wanted, so I stood up, peed a bit in the diaper and went back to bed with the wet diaper on. The leaks really surprised me. Usually I can wake up way more desperate than I was last night and hold for a long time. The alcohol must have had a major effect on me.

Depends Maximum I think gravity was going the wrong way. I try to keep my dick pointing down into the padded parts, but it doesn't always work.
