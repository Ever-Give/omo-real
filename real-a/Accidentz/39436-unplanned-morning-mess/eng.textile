So i awoken really early this morning in bed still half asleep. Ever have those times where you are half awake and suddenly feel ridiculously horny? Well that happened to me just earlier. But this wasnt the usual kind though. Laying there with my half conscious mind I realized my insane need to pee. Now i have a habit of drinking alot of water, so getting up during the night to release a massive gush is a regular thing. So i guess it didnt hit me till the early morning.

Anyways, still warm and cozy, half asleep with a full throbbing bladder, those naughty holds and wets ive done was giving me intense waves of arousal in my half conscious mind. I had a strong urge to do something about it. So with full awareness of what I was about to do, ignoring the cleaning consequences afterwards, I just start letting my pee flow. The feeling of letting go of a full bladder while extremely comfortable I cannot even begin to describe in words. I was just laying there so cozy, soaking myself (nude sleeper btw) in wet warmth. As soon as I finished peeing I had realized what i'd done, and regretted it bad. Ive only ever wet my sheets intentionally, twice before this for the same reason. And I guess I forgot that the cleanup was just not worth it. Luckily I have a waterproof mattress cover. But i am definately never doing this again.
