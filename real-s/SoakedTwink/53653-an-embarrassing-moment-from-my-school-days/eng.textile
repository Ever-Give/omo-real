So when I was about 16 so about three years ago I had been at a friends house on school night it was his birthday. I had stayed in his house until about 2 Am and by the time I got home it was about 3 Am and I had to get up at 7 O’clock that morning but I slept in until 8 because my parents were at work. I was rushing to get ready for school and I filled my 2 Litre bottle of water before I left but I forgot to go to the bathroom and ran for my bus I noticed a slight annoyance in my bladder but I ignored it. When I got into school I had history first class and the teacher was pretty nice. Also I did go to a catholic school so we wore uniforms which consisted of grey slacky type trousers most of us back then would get tighter trousers cause they looked nicer and were a lot more comfortable to wear.

But anyway I got into history class and it was a double period so it was an hour and twenty minutes long about 15 minutes in I had already drunk more than half my water at this point my bladder was noticeably full.

Eventually I fell asleep my teacher left me for about 30 minutes according to my friends eventually she thought it would be funny to wake me up by hitting the table with a wooden ruler and it gave me such a fright I hopped of the chair almost but during that half an hour my body had time to process that other litre of water immediately after she woke me I could feel the warm liquid collide with my pants and once I started peeing...

I couldn’t stop it flowed down my legs and I couldnt hold it back a puddle quickly formed in my seat and below my feet everyone in the class was looking at me I was so embarrassed but I got turned on when I peed all over myself and because I opted for tighter pants they were a bit more flexible and when I stood up to leave 1 or 2 people realised I was “excited” about my accident I was also wearing white socks at the time and they had yellow stains in them which I thought was so nice. Hope you enjoyed this post let me know if you or someone you know had a similar experience
