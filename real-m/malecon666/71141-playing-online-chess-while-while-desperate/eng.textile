I regularly play online chess on www.chess.com. Sometimes I also play while drinking a lot of ice tea, getting more and more desperate during the game (I usually do games where each player has 20 minutes time - 40 minutes is usually enough to get really desperate, if my bladder is already filled when the game starts). The problem is that I usually lose, even with players which are below my level, when I'm desperate (guess why...?).

Now I thought, perhaps it would be a nice idea if some fellow omorashi fans would participate in an online chess game also? We could even use the chat function to broadcast our "desparation level"? If you are willing to do a chess game like described, PM me. (My usual level when not desperate is around 900)
