So I was sitting in my bed and I needed to pee pretty bad, 9 on the desperation scale. So I’m laying there trying to fall asleep and not particularly wanting to wet the bed but not entirely willing to get up and go to the bathroom. I could feel my bladder bulging somewhat uncomfortably and I got an idea, I sucked in my gut and pressed my thumb down hard about half an inch below my bellybutton. Low and behold urine uncontrollably shot out. I definitely don’t have the strongest bladder in the world but it worked like a charm. It of course stopped working once I had emptied the tank some so I’ve been chugging water determinant to try this again to make sure it works. Will Update!

Ok didn’t work too well, I wouldn’t recommend overusing this trick, it works only if you’re really desperate. Trying to hard to uses it when I wasn’t left me with a bruse.

Yeah I’m not going to try that one again until I can find a way to do it without hurting.
