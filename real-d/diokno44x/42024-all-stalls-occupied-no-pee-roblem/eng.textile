This happened in third grade. I had stopped wearing diapers by then, which I regretted as it would have saved my pants on numerous occasions, the summer before.

Now on this occasion, it was a free dress day, and I had quite the full bladder. This was during recess, and as I went to the bathroom closest to where I was, I felt my bladder control waining. I cupped my hands over my crotch, and entered. Unfortunately, all the urinals were either in use, as we're the stalls. Unable to hold it anymore, I exited the bathroom, stood in a corner where no one could see me easily, and just let go into my pants, breathing a sigh of relief. Once my pants had dried, I went back to play with my friends

That’s pretty risky! Did you leave a puddle, or what?

Well, a small one, but I don't think anyone I know saw me.

At a school I attended the toilets were across the playground - it was a modernized Victorian building. Inevitably as we were in the 6-9 year old age band kids got caught short and although discouraged staff were realistic about wet pants. In summer one teacher would give two options "go and see the school nurse and get clean pants and a letter home" or "let it dry and hope mum doesn't notice". Of course mums always did but it did your street cred no good to be seen sitting outside the nurses office because everyone knew why you were there.
