So as I've said in a couple of my experience stories, I used to have really bad bladder problems to the point of needing diapers. I only have daytime accidents once in awhile and, well, it just kinda happened. I was sitting on my chair eating and orange and watching the movie Secret Window when all of a sudden I really needed to go, then I started peeing so I got up and had to run all the way upstairs to my bathroom. I had to waddle when I got to the upstairs landing, and leaked the whole way to the bathroom. As soon as I closed the bathroom door, I lost it. Before I knew it I was standing in a puddle, my socks soaked and my legs saturated. I wiped myself off with a couple of the adult wipes upon which I stay stocked, and immediately sat down to write this. Thanks for reading!
