Definitely just sweat spots, I swear!

So I was drinking about two liters of Diet Coke when my urge to pee struck me like a lightning bolt.

I ran up stairs, having to stop and dance along the way to prevent myself from losing it.

I immediately started potty-dancing, unable to resist the extreme urge.

I was wearing a red hoodie along with loose grey sweatpants as I desperately danced on the bathroom floor.

Every time I went to take a picture, I would leak, and the urine slowly but not visibly would run down my pantsleg.

Not even that far into holding, I peed for about 20 seconds, and it made a huge spot on the front of my sweatpants. I could have gotten away with saying it was a sweat spot, but my bladder wasn't done.

I bent down for a second, releasing my leg from being squeezed against each other, to pick up my phone, when my bladder lets out pee flowing through my sweatpants like a rushing waterfall.

I was so embarrassed, unable to hide the stain on my hoodie and my now drenched sweatpants.

This is my biggest wetting so far, but luckily my sweatpants absorbed all of my pee so that I wouldn't leave a puddle.

I thank you all for reading my experience, it was quite fun! I love suggestions, so if you want to recommend a wetting for me, do so in the comments!

I love you all!
