So this occurred when I was seven or so, and I was at a local Ross with my mom. I had to go to the bathroom and as I had run out of diapers (We would buy more at the Toys R Us (RIP) which was more or less next door, with a TK Noodle sandwiched inbetween Ross and Toys R Us.), I told my mother thus. She went to try out clothes in the nearby changingmy area when I went to use the bathroom.

As I entered the bathroom, well, let's say whoever was in there did NOT flush afterwards, plus I was feeling a tad bit adventerchievious (adventurous/mischievous) that day. Not wanting to dare and use the toilet, which while the rim wasn't gas station dirty, still had a few flecks on it, Thankfully, there was a stepstool nearby and I used it to climb up to the sink, Yanking my pants down I began doing my business in the sink. About half-way through me releasing my bladder and bowels into the porcelain sink, the door knob began jimmying open. Quickly clenching and getting my pants up, I managed to hop off the sink as a girl my age opened the door. Thankfully her mother pulled her away and closed the door. Once that was done I finished up in the sink, wiped, and rejoined my mother,

Funny enough a similar incident would occur when I was 13 or so at the same Ross.
