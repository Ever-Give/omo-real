Anyone else enjoy wetting while wearing a sauna suit?

Went for a morning walk bursting with a full bladder. Decided to wear my sauna suit to add some extra calorie burning to the workout. It was difficult to walk too fast with my bladder bursting but I was enjoying it.

About half way through the wall I started to leak piss into the suit. It felt great to be wetting in public and not noticeable to others around, or so I thought. It felt like most of the piss was pooling at the bottom of the pant legs but it was actually dripping out of them. I turned to look at something behind me, after letting out a long stream, to see a piss trail along the path I had walked.

Came home to a sauna suit filled with piss and sweat.
