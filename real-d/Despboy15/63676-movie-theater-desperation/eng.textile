Has anyone ever had a close call or wet themselves in a movie theater? I had a couple close calls. One of them was after a 3+ hour movie and a large water. I had to wait so long because the line went on forever. By the time I was the last person, I was openly holding myself, bouncing around ,hands dug into my crotch. I finally got to the urinal, and by this time I was the only one in the bathroom. I don’t know about you guys, but when I’m super desperate I basically forget how to do anything. I fumbled with the zipper as it started to come out. By the time I managed to slip it through, I had a softball sized wet spot on my jeans.
