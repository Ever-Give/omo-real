I've come up with a fun, fairly quick holding/wetting game... I'm not generally a massive holder as love the feeling of relief too much, but the longer you can hold on and more desperate you get, the sweeter that relief is of course

With an empty bladder and wearing your best underwear, nappy or whatever you like to wet in, start by drinking a pint/half litre of water or cordial. Then half an hour later, ramp it up with a pint of caffeinated fizzy drink such as Coke... then after another half hour, finish off with a pint of beer. See how long you can hold on after finishing the beer! (Can be a challenge to just do so before finishing it...)

Additional bonus challenge, if you can make it to two hours after the start, throw in a coffee...
