Passing Out on Full Bladder

So, last night I was in bed wearing a blue bralette, cyan nightie, and a pair of frilly white panties with a blue bow; watching YouTube videos. I was starting to fall asleep, and I also needed to pee, but figured I could wait until the current video was finished to go pee and then sleep. I placed my head on my pillow, just meaning to rest it briefly, but it didn't turn out that way. I closed my eyes, opened them slowly, closed my eyes, opened them halfway slowly. The last thing I remember before waking up to a wet bed was the pressure in my bladder decreasing as a relaxing warmth spread through my panties.

For the brief moments I was aware of it. Not so much the cleanup in the morning from not wearing a diaper.

That's a great description! I'm sure that would tempt many women to try it...

If I'm being honest, the way the way the warmth spread, I think it would've been relaxing enough to take away any control I might've had were I fully conscious and able to hold.
