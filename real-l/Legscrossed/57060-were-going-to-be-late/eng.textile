This is a one of the earliest instances that i remember enjoying a full bladder on purpose. I was 8 years old, and held my pee for several hours, just to see how long i can wait.

It was a weekend afternoon, and I was purposely ignoring my bladder as I played in my room. My mom told me we were heading out soon and that i had to get ready. I did not get ready on time, as I was really distracted by my game, and distractes by my need to pee. I had never held so much pee on purpose before and i was curious how long i could wait.

My bladder situation went from bad to worse. I had to go really really bad, but decided to keep waiting and playing. I started to hold myself and squirm around.

Suddenly, my mom came in and urged me to get ready quickly. When she was my obvious pee pee dance, she took me by the shoulders and steered me into the bathroom.

I told her i didn't need to go, but she said to hurry up and use the toilet because we needed to go out.

I peed a lot into the toilet and was extemely relieved.
