When I was at kindergarten, sometimes I had some problems with this. I drank a lot of fluids and then i go to bed (in my country, at kindergarten there are also beds in order to sleep 2 or 3 hours before you can go home). And 20 minutes later i felt some ''pain'' in my bladder and I was afraid to tell my teachers about this because I thought they wouldn't let me use the toilet so I peed myself afterwards.

P.S. And here comes the funny part:No one saw me peeing myself,like nothing happened at all. I mean, no one asked me what happened to me.

My question for you is: Have you ever experienced the same thing?
