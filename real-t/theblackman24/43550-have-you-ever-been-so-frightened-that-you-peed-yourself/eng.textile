I have a terrible phobia of mold, moldy bread, moldy fruits, anything with mold scares the living crap out of me.

A few years ago I was driving home from shopping and I saw an Ice chest on the sidewalk. My bladder was probably a 5 out of 10 so it didn't bother me. I was curious about it because I needed an Ice chest and I was thinking It was just abandoned. I made a you turn parked next to it then walked towards it. When I got their didnt smell anything rotten so I didnt think anything of it. I opened it and I completely froze from what I saw on the inside. The inside of the ice chest was coded with black mold. I panic attack that I couldn't move for a second then I jumped back and started running and screaming. When I stopped panicking and stopped running to relax for a second, I felt wetness in my pants so I looked down and I saw that I completely wet myself. My pants where completely soaked, I didnt even notice that I peed myself when I was panicking.

Has this ever happen to any of you guys or girls? What was the story? Im curious
