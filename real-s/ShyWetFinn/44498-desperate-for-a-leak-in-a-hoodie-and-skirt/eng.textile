So I wore a blue hoodie and a blue skirt (which was actually a dress, but I had a hoodie over it. Smart outfit idea, right?) into the bathroom where I wasn't quite that desperate to relieve myself just yet.

$$

However, after drinking an entire bottle of water (plus a soda from before), I began needing to pee more, resulting in a potty dance.

$$

I lifted my leg, hoping that it would hide the feeling of desperation, only to result in a tiny leak.

$$

I tried to stay as still as possible, to keep leaks as minimal as they could be.

$$

At the verge of losing control, I squeezed my legs together as best as possible and applied pressure to by bladder to prevent the urine that was already aching to be released.

$$

Embarrassed, I was forced to meet my bladder's fate as it was all let out.

$$

I felt relieved as my pee made it's way to the floor from the bottom of my skirt, but I couldn't hide it due to the fact that my hoodie was stained, too.

I accomplished one thing that day, however; that being my longest and most desperate wetting so far, and I hope to do more holds this Summer!
