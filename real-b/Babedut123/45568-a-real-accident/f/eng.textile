Thinking back I can only remember one real (unplanned) accident. I was about 15 and was out jogging. When I was about 2 miles away from home, I started to fell a small urge to pee, but since it was small, I choose to ignore it. Soon after, it was nearing an 8/10. I quickly turned around, picked up the pace and headed home. As time went by, the desperation grew and when I was halfway home, I started to leak a little. I panicked and started to run, but it was to no use. As I ran my bladder gave up and left a wet trail behind me.

Thinking back makes me want to try more unplanned accidents, but it's hard since you usually plan to do a hold or wetting.
