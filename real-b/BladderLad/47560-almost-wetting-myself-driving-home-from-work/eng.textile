Held through long work meeting and then thought I would hold for the long journey home!

Never been so desperate by the point I entered my drive!!

Leaked a tiny bit when taking shoes off

Not my biggest quantity but certainly very desperate

That was quite a bit to be holding, probably felt great to let go. I'm sure others would have wet themselves once or twice on the way home.

Thanks! Was 1100mls

Quite a bit less than what I can hold in controlled conditions!

I am always holding on my way home. Most of the time I make it but not always.

I just witnessed another man's genitalia, and my eyes have been scorched. Be back, I need my trusty friend, bleach.

It's not funny, you!

Well, at least you aren't one of those asshole porn uploaders saying "FEMAIL SOILS HERSELF" and setting it as the title, only for me to click the link and BAM, Dude!

And don't get me started on how many times futas have tricked me till I'm pissed off.

Well it does say contains nudity

I didn't even realize it was you, mate. I thought it was female since that's the majority of omo content I've come across.

Fair enough should have labelled it-genuine oversite!

Hope you have recovered??

Not fully. I haven't seen enough good female omorashi yet to unburn the memory from my head. At least the bleach dissolved most of it.

Lol ok

{{29 minutes ago, TheMaskedVoid said:

But yeah, if you're including nudity and such, please include tags like "male" so people know.

}}

Yeah normally do, also often a problem with female content not being labelled as well

{{24 minutes ago, TheMaskedVoid said:

Female content not being labeled and me stumbling upon it doesn't really bother me, but there should always be tags.

}}

Lol I know but there seems to be an expectation from some site users that only Male content should be labelled

{{Just now, TheMaskedVoid said:

It's a modern world so both need to be labeled.

}}

Agree

I agree as well, if they are gender-specific. Some threads apply to both genders (or no gender), and occasionally here they have the wrong label. Because I am a minority participant here I expect that many items posted will not interest me.

}}

Yeah just get a bit fed up with straight guys on here who think the site should only exist for their interests alone! Having said that-my bad-should have labelled the vid!
