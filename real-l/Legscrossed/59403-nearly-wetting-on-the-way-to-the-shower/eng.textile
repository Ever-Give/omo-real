In the middle of the night, I woke up with a VERY full bladder. I was sleepy, so I gave myself a quick squeeze and went back to sleep.

Come morning, I woke up bursting. I felt like i was about to start pissing in the bed!

Since i was going to shower anyway, I decided to just piss it out in the shower. That almost ended on a wet note. I scrambled to the shower, and started to hurriedly undress. A small leak wet my boxers as i bent down to take off my socks. I had to grab myself to stop it. I quickly pulled off my boxers and made to step into the shower. Before i had completely entered the shower, a strong stream of piss burst from me. Luckily, my penis was facing inside the shower already so i didn't get any on the floor. I had to go so bad that I pissed like a race horse against the back wall of the shower. It was almost as urgent as a deliberate hold. amazing relief.

I sometimes plan to pee in the shower rather than waste water on an unnecessary flush, but waiting for the water to get hot can be too long! I think hearing the spray makes the urgency worse.

I try to wait for the water to get hot as well, but this time i didn't even have time to turn on the water
