Another wet accident i figured I share. Woke up yesterday morning with a noticeable urge to pee & seeing as I had some time before I had to get up I figured I’d hold on until I absolutely had to get up and pee. Well after some holding & rubbing and a little dancing and wiggling in bed I finally decided to get up to shower. I paused to look in the mirror and straighten myself out and kinda relaxed and let a nice stream into my boxers. So at this point I’m now bursting and already wet so I made a quick dash for the bathroom, started up the shower and just hoped right in wearing my blue boxers. I’m just a couple breaths as soon as I relaxed again the flood gates opened and out came a massive pissy accident. It crept up towards my butt a little and felt great!

I included the pics of the initial spurt & the aftermath and then most of the accident. I’ll see if I can add the rest of the video

I'm sure many of us wake up and want to lie there and enjoy the sensations from our full bladder. Some of us like to get up and delay taking our morning pee. I'd guess that you were more full than you thought you were.

Oh I was super full. Idk if I had the courage to pee the bed but I was close and it was super relaxing to finally let go
