This is a narrative of me reading a true experience I had in my early twenties when I worked as a children’s party hostess in a very busy soft play centre. I have posted the story before but this is me reading it for those who might enjoy hearing my voice.

It's really hot to hear you read that story! Especially because it's about your own desperation experience, an amazing one!

I wonder if you use the same tactic when you read as when you write desperation stories

I did indeed…hence getting flustered once or twice

Did you leak while reading?

Just a few drops. I did this on the first try but if I’d had to retake I’d definitely have burst!

It could have been my imagination but I'm sure I heard you squirming around in your chair once or twice

I can confirm that wasn’t just your imagination xx

This is so hot! Me and the wife loved it. Please do more of these!! You could eve do something like “time out guys, I’m seriously bursting here not sure if I can hold till the end” and then keep reading so we all know your bladders state!

I definitely plan on doing more. If anyone has any particular requests I’ll do my best to oblige. There’s a series I write on here some time ago now about my experiences as a desperate mum so thinking of doing those next.

That was lovely to listen too. I would love to hear the desperate mum stories read out

They are on my list. Also the experiences of my time in student halls of residence. Hopefully people enjoy those too.
