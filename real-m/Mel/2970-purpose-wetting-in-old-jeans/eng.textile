I was looking through a bunch of clothes I had yesterday, trying them on and sorting out which ones didn't really fit me anymore or I just didn't want. I looked at the pile of clothes that I was going to get rid of, and had an idea: Before I get rid of them, why don't I pee in them? I put away the clothes I wanted to keep, and turned my attention to the other pile. I picked out a pair of tight jeans along with an old pair of panties, and moved the others into a corner. The jeans barely fit me.

The ends were above my ankles, and were so tight on me it was a wonder I could even wear them. I got my bladder full and stepped into the shower. It's always been hard for me to pee on purpose, so it took a little bit for me to start. Eventually I got a little bit to come out. Soon enough a stream was coming out and soaking them. It ran down my legs and formed a large puddle at my feet. The entire back side of my jeans was soaked along with a good area of the front. Afterwards I just threw the jeans out. It was a great experience and I plan to do it again, but I do know I have to be more careful because as I stepped out I slipped on the pee and hit my head >.>
