Did a major hold earlier measuring a respectable 1.3 litres

Had to go out an hour later and became super desperate on way home

Trying to bring shopping etc in, I lost control completely on my door step , fortunately regained control but not until I had lost a substantial amount!

Very weird as I never normally leak, however it was very cold and I guess my muscles were weak!
