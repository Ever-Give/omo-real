Yes, TGIF!

Had a little window of time when the sun came out after the clouds and storms of 2-3PM so I took a seat on the patio and let the sun soak my skin a little. It wasn't too long before my bladder increased from the 2 beers I drank (plus all the hydration earlier during the work day). Then, I decided I should capture some video. So I shot 3 snippets of video as I let the pee flow through my little blue/yellow swim trunks. Hope you like it!
