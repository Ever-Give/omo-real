Once again the spookiest day of the year is upon us. But for some, Halloween is also the wettest day of the year. In fact when you consider the kind of events people get up to, I'd bet real money that more people wet themselves on Halloween than almost any other day.

So how about we hear your stories of accidents on Halloween. Couldn't hold it while trick-or-treating and ended up soaking your costume? Wet yourself from fear while at a haunted house? Got too drunk at a Halloween party and leaked in your underwear during the taxi ride home? Or maybe you just decided today was the day for some nice quiet wet fun at home. Here's your place to tell us all about it.
