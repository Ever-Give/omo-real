Just a funny story that I felt like sharing that I remembered. Not much wetting just a story. I remember getting a chuckle after I found out what rapid desperation was and did to you.

So I knew I had to be out for a while for grocery chores and a visit to the mall and I was pondering how to make my trip less painful. 16 year old me had heard and experienced that concentrated pee was hard to hold. So I had the amazing idea to "flush my bladder" by drinking a lot of water until just 30 minutes before leaving and peeing like every 5 minutes. My mom thought I was sick with a stomach flu again when she heard me to go the bathroom like 20000 times in an hour. For those of you unaware, this is the first step of rapid desperation although done in a more quick fashion. 

It surely worked though because I remember myself being real proud when I started to only dribble clear water. Its effects hit me right away and I had to take a pee break before I left. The problem is that rapid desperation's effects don't go away right away after you first pee. I was bursting throughout. After almost losing it on the way to the mall, I practically hugged the bathroom. I cut it short and came back an hour-ish later with soaked panties.
