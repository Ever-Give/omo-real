Unexpected accidents

I have a pretty established routine for making myself have an accident these days. It usually involves multiple holds, giving up and wetting or going in the toilet several times before I get to the point of really losing control. For some reason tonight was different. I started drinking at maybe 8:30pm, chugged about 1.2L of water at 10, went to a bar and drank a couple beers and 2 pints of water, came home and drank another beer and another 2L of water, and lo and behold, I was wetting myself like a child. I mean zero control, pissing all over myself and the floor over and over again. After an hour of gradually soaking myself, I finally gave in and made a huge puddle on my bedroom floor.

Now I'm sitting in my wet pants, getting desperate again, and my girlfriend is telling me that I won't be allowed to use the toilet tomorrow, but I have to drink 500ml of water per hour. This is gonna be difficult...

Update: I desperately wet my bed all night. I kept waking up squirming, and just relieved myself into my sheets. I got up and drank my first 500ml, and then almost immediately had an accident while I was making coffee. Not a big one, but enough to make a wet patch on the front of my pjs. I'm looking forward to much more of this.

I'll be checking in on the Live Action thread occasionally through the day. Enjoy your bladders!
