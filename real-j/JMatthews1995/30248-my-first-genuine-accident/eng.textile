I was at work today and I had drank loads. Coming home from work I needed to pee a bit but I didn't think much off it. The tea that I had must have come up on my bladder really fast. I was stuck in traffic so stupidly desperate to pee!

I got stuck in traffic!!! I was ridiculously desperate and there was nothing I could do. I managed to get back into my house but as I was going into the bathroom I could feel it leaking out of the tip of my penis! There was nothing I could do! I dived onto the toilet to just minimize the mess caused! I sat and wet through my boxers and work trousers just totally uncontrollably.

I was very lucky that none of my family were in and I quickly got changed and washed the wet clothes! (which luckily I do on Fridays anyway)

It was so worrying and scary but I really enjoyed it :D

I was very lucky tbh! It was a lot of fun and a proper rush as well! I want to to it again soon but I want proper desperation and a proper wetting and soaking after!
