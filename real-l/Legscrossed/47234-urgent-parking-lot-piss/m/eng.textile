I headed to visit family, and the drive there was very long. It had been a hot summer day, and I had hydrated plenty. The drive was 7 hours long, and I had only stopped once to use the bathroom during that time.

I had been ignoring my urge to pee for over an hour, and was starting to get fidgety. I drove on, keeping an eye out for a gas station. There weren't any nearby. I shifted sideways in my seat an. I was driving through a rural area, and it was mostly fields.

I was an hour out from my destination, but my bladder was running out of time. In about 10 more minutes, I became frantic to urinate. I grabbed my crotch in frustration, bounced in my seat, and whimpered involuntarily as a few drops escaped into my boxers. My pee was starting to dribble out.

To my immense relief, I saw McDonalds ahead, and pulled in. I composed myself as I got out of the car and stiffly walked to the McDonalds. The door was locked. Only the drive through was open. I pushed against the door once more, in disbelief as i bounced on the spot. I had to grab myself to keep it in.

I needed to piss in the next few minutes or i was going to wet mysef. My penis was jutting forward slightly in my athletic shorts. I was almost going in my pants....

I couldnt take it anymore. I ran behind my car, pulled my shorts out of the way, and poured the contents of my bladder onto the parking lot. The relief was dizzying.
