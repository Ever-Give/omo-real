Soooo About 2 weeks ago i started having accidents quite alot i have wet myself 13 times im a 21 male ive never had problems with my bladder before i could hold for hours and hours but recently during lectures ive been constantly holding large amounts of pee in and i think this is the cause of my issue its happened twice during lectures and a few other times in public the urge judst comes over me in minutes i never make it anymore ive wet the bed like 9 times but for some reason i love it and i do on purpose now it just feels amazing. My friends say i should wear a diaper but i like being soaked in public places i wear tight fitting jeans aswell so its really obvious that i have wet myself
