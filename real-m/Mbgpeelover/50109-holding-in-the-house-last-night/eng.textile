Things have been super busy here but last night I was catching up online with a friend I really care about and during the catch up I started to need to pee. My friend is in another country and we don’t get online at the same time often so I didn’t wish to interrupt the conversation just to visit the loo.

Of course we were chatting for hours and I was getting more and more desperate so I used my phone to take some pics.

The first was when I was in my kitchen making myself another cup of tea and had a very sudden urge. I checked my underwear in pic two but thankfully they survived dry. I was only wearing my nightdress and I was so close to peeing myself it was that intense. Eventually a little leaked and I ran to the loo.

Have done that before! But eventually had to confess how desperate I was

I would love to chat to a man and think think that he could be as desperate as I was and then he suddenly confesses his predicament. Very sexy!

Did you have to tell your friend about your desperation when the leak occurred? Sounds exciting

Eventually I admitted to them that I had to go urgently
