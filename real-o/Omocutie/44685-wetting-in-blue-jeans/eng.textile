This is my first time posting, hope you like it.

So I had to run some errands today, so I decided to see if I could hold whilst I was out. I drank 1L of water before I left the house. By the time I was nearly ready to come home I was about a 6/10 so I grabbed a 500ml bottle of water and finished it before the 15 minute bike ride home. Riding my bike around was fine to begin with but as my bladder filled up the holes in the road started to become awkward the more full I got as every little bump I felt a twinge. By the time I got home I has leaked a tiny bit, and I was about an 8/10 and I wasn't sure how much I could hold it. I tried to do a couple of things at home but I couldn't concentrate and I was dancing around to try and hold it. By the time I made it to the bathroom I had a bit of a wet patch (oops).

I tried to hold for as long as I could but I was slowly leaking and the wet patch was growing. I knew it wouldn't be long. $$

It didn't take me long to lose control, here's a cute little action shot

By the time I was done I was soaked. $$

Hope you enjoyed this as much as I did x
