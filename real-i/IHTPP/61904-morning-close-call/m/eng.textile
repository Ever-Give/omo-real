I woke up this morning and felt extreme pressure. Wanted to hold ti for a whilw but i began to walk down stairs after getting ready for work and a wave of pure urgency hit me. I noticed how much pressure i was holding and squirted twice. Rushing to the kitchen to get something to measure a huge squirt happened. This was a great treat to wake up to.

I've honestly never been more frantic for a pee, i rolled around a bit and was trying to hold onto it. I whipped it out and tried my best to hold on but it had to come out
