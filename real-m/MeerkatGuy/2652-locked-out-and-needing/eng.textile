As I type I am on my laptop in bed. There are two workman replacing our toilet and it is out of bounds for the next hour.

I didn't know this was going to happen >.< This morning I've had two large glasses of water and two glasses of milk. I am in desperate need of relief!! >w< I can feel the cold water in my bladder pressing against me for relief >.< I'm not going to write too much detail, because I'm in as much pain as it is. I've resorted to lieing in bed naked, but the quilt rested on a.. well.. 'sensitive area' unexpectedly and caused for a sudden lapse of concentration and a small spurt on my chest.

WISH ME LUCK!! D: .. >.<

An hour to go! *pines loudly*
