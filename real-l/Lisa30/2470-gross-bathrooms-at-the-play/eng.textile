This happened to me this past weekend. I went to a play that was being done by my niece at her school. Well, about half way through the first act, I had to pee, but I decided to put it off til intermission. The lights came up and I made a beeline for the ladies, and found it to be so gross. There was no way I was gonna pee in there. So I went back to my seat and held it through the rest of the play...at which time I had to go so bad. Then my family wanted to talk to me for a bit, and my niece wanted to say hi and everything. I wish that my bladder wasn't telling me otherwise. So after finishing with my family, I had to get home to meet some friends, and I was running late so I had to hold it for about 45 minutes. I get home and I made a rush for the potty. OMG it felt so good to pee.
