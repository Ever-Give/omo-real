About 3 years ago i found my old sweat pants that i've been looking for for a while. grandma told me to wash them and as soon as she did i got the idea to put them to use since they needed to be cleaned anyway. My grandma left for church this morning but i didn't have to pee so i sat back and waited, passing the time by playing fruit assassin and doing naughty things. But i still didn't get the urge to do anythign yet... pretty soon my grandma was home and i thought my plans were ruined but i said i was going to do it and i was. I started drinking water but we didn't have much to besides water... then it kicked in.

I felt that i had to pee instantly and i could feel pressure in my bladder, i had on a pair of jeans already but switched to my gray sweats as fast as i could and walked into the bathroom with my ipod for pics (which i dont have anymore). I layed out a towel and stood on it relaxing alittle feeling the warm pee run down my legs and darken the sweats. it felt soo good >///< it's been so long since i peed myself. I took my cloths to the wash and took a quick shower to get cleaned up.
