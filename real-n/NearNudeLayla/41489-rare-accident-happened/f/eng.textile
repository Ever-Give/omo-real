My accident wasn't anything very eventful. Sometimes, when I have stressful dreams, such as dreaming about work after I had just gotten home from a stressful day at work, I'll pee the bed. That's exactly what happened to me this morning. It was still kinda warm, so I wasn't asleep long after I peed. My wife, although not big into omo, is understanding of my fetish, and she is also understanding of my occasional stress-related bed wettings.

I honestly did not want this accident to happen this morning because I had plans to do a lot more than laundry, including other laundry. But my day did get better, and now I can look back on it as a pleasant memory.

I'm going to try to hold tonight so I can wake with a full bladder in the morning and REALLY hold while my wife is at work. As long as I don't dream about work again, I should be accident free.

As frustrating when it happened because it was the worst possible time for it to happen, but i'm not upset anymore. today was great after morning was over ^^
