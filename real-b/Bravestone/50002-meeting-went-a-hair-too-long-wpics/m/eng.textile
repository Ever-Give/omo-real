Meeting went a hair too long (w/pics)

I started to leave a meeting 90 minutes in to use the men's room. I was asked if I could wait we were wrapping up. I'm the sort who never leaves meetings so I was already dying! But I acquiesced. Sat down and crossed my legs under the conference table. 30 minutes later I'm bouncing my crossed legs and squeeeeezing them tight together each bounce. And it started happening. Each squeeze of my thighs made me pee a little. My face started burning red and I prayed we finished soon. After 3 or 4 leaks into my boxers we adjourned. Thank goodness for navy jeans as you couldn't really tell. But my boxers tell a different story. Needless to say I am commando the days remainder. Sorry for brevity but I am at work.

I was dying. I sprinted to restroom as soon as meeting ended.
