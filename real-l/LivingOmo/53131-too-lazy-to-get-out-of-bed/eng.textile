Last night I was lying in bed with my boyfriend, and we were just breathing together and half-dozing. I was lying on him, and he was curled around behind me like a comfy armchair. There was no way I was getting up. I began masturbating to the sexiness of feeling safe and warm in a lover’s embrace. I did kinda have to go though. As the pressure in my bladder built I felt myself relaxing more and more and I led my partner’s hand town to me to stroke me. He gently, rhythmically rubbed up and down and I sighed and leaked on his hand. He instantly became focused and aroused. He moaned as his hand grew slippery. I closed my eyes and felt like I was pleasantly losing consciousness I emptied my bladder slowly and orgasmed intensely, repeatedly. We did this for a little over an hour and the puddle under us grew and grew into a deep lake. We had to use four towels to soak it up before going to bed.
