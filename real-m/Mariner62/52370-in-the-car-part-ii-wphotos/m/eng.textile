I did this last week but didn't get photos. Today I had a 540 mile drive from where I was at to home, which provided me with the chance to do one of my favorite things, wet in the car. I knew I had to stop one time for gas, so I couldn't wet before then Here's how it happened. After filling up, I held for a little while and with 280 miles left in the trip, the first spurt happened.

Just a small spot. I continued to hold until mile 225. At that point I could no longer hold it (as the next three photos show the progression of the wet spot.$$

I continued drinking the beverages I had packed for trip and drove on. Down to 115 miles to home. Once again feeling the urge to pee, I let it go. ( Flood lines this time and I thought the puddle in the black plastic bag might show up also).$$

To finish off the trip. I was able to finish emptying my bladder as I backed into the driveway. (No picture for this one, as my pants had become so wet, there was wet patch to see).

Hope those who see these, enjoy.
