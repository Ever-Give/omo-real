Unexpected wet patch

I'm old, so I've beern trying Tribulus (herbal supplement) to try to get some interest happening.

I was writing my 'shitty little eBooks', which, you guessed it, are about shota (mainly) having a 'crap' load of fun, when I got a feeling of needing to pee, but my bladder was empty. I resisted, but suddenly sent a long squirt of seminal fluid into and through my briefs and sport pants. My mistake was to try to dry it with toilet paper, which just embedded itself in the sticky fluid, creating a white spot, or as Mr Fry once said "the stain that shames". I have developed a technique for covering this - a little olive oil spray on a tissue, dabbed genty on the light coloured area fixes it well until the next wash. It's just 'happened' again, but without the stimulus (just a long train ride), and not such a big squirt, but this time I'll ignore it because seminal fluid evaporates readily, as I discovered in my teen.

I'm putting it down to the Tribulus, but wonder if anyone else has had a similar event.
