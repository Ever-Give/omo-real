Gone food shopping and then ran a few errands with Brenda today. By the time we were done and on the way home Brenda sheepishly confides in me that she thinks she's about to wet her pants and can't wait much longer. By this time I'm needing to go kind of bad myself. All I could do is tell Brenda that the seats are vinal anyway and cleaning the seats isn't a problem so just go in your pants rather than suffer needlessly. She does and as soon as she finishes I pee mine. Now we have two pair of soaked Jeans and undies to wash. I'm sure glad we have a washing machine and I'm blessed that Brenda is lax with wetting her pants just like I am.
