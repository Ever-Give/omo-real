I'm currently a sophomore in college. I tend to get really bad headaches. I literally can't fall asleep when I get them at night, so I have to take 3-4 advils in order to fall asleep. But I've noticed a pattern. Every time I take Advil before bed, I end up wetting my bed. This happened at least 10 times throughout my freshman year and the first few weeks of my sophomore year. I first noticed this in high school, after I suffered a back injury in football. Granted, I was taking stronger, medical grade pain killers, but I wet my bed that entire week while taking pain killers. Does anyone know if there is a correlation between painkillers and bedwetting? I love a good bedwetting, but it's super inconvenient while I'm dorming.
