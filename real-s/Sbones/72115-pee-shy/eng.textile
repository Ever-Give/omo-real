Pee shy?

I've recently started a topic about my personal experience with omo and it reminded me about a problem I used to have. Pee shyness. It's something in your mind which prevents so from peeing outside or even in public toilet.

Have you ever had the same problem? If you had, how did you cope with it? And how it influenced your life?

I have what I like to affectionately refer to as pseudo-pee-shy-ness. I get pee shy in very specific situations. More often than not, if I feel any level of awkward, I can't go. This arbitrary awkwardness can be caused by walking into the bathroom at the same time as a stranger, entering a bathroom where a stranger is washing their hands, when I enter a bathroom where a group is chitchatting, or anything vaguely similar to that. I either have to wait it out (which tends to make me feel more awkward) or I have to leave and try again later.

I feel you. That's exactly what happened to me during school years many times.
