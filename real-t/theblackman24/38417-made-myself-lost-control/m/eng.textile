I decided to drink 80ozs of beet to see how pee I can hold it. I wanted to see how long I can last with a full bladder. I chugged all 80 oz in a matter of 10 minutes and I started to get really drunk quickly. A little while later my bladder started to fill up with beer but I wanted to hold it. I have a very small bladder so I became full super fast. When I drink alcohol, my bladder becomes super over active. I wanted to make myself hold my pee for as long as possible so I took off my pants and sat down. I didnt even grab myself. my bladder became so full that I started tearing up, It got so bad that I couldn't wait any longer. I tried to stop my pee, but i couldnt and it cam squirting out. I started crying uncontrollably as I lost control of my urine and the pee started making a puddle.
