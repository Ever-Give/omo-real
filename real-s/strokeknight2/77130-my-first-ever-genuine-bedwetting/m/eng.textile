My first ever genuine bedwetting

I woke up last night at some point because I had to pee, and I knew right away that I had to go badly enough that even if I went back to sleep, I'd wake up again before morning. So I decided to just get up and use the toilet. I rolled over and pushed myself up... and put my hand in a puddle. I was definitely not expecting that! I thought it might be sweat, since I've never wet the bed. I smelled my hand and sure enough, I had peed in my sleep.

I felt around and the wet spot was the size of a dinner plate, thankfully! As much as I like peeing in bed, I like to do it on my own terms and not when I actually need to be sleeping. So I used the toilet and came back with a towel to put down over the wet spot. Laundry could wait until morning.

I have no idea what caused it. I haven't been drinking alcohol. I wasn't exceptionally tired. And I like to sleep diapered sometimes and listen to bedwetting hypnosis files, but I didn't do any of that. I don't have to see clients tomorrow so if it happens again tonight it won't be the end of the world. Just a little concerning.

Overall it was a nice little experience! I finally wet in my sleep, and it wasn't enough to cause me to strip the bed before I could go back to sleep. Has anyone else had a random, sober, bedwetting like this?
