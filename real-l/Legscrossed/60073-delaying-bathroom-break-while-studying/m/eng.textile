This happened junior year of college. It was the week before finals, and i sat in the library, studying on my laptop... i had drank plenty of coffee all day, to stay focused. It was late afternoon, and i had last peed just after lunch. I have been needing to piss for a long while, but ignored it.

I was reluctant to get up to go because i would have to pack my laptop in my backpack and take it with me. It seemed like too much of a hassle. I was almost done studying anyway and would go home. I could wait until home...

I remained absorbed in my work for a while longer. But i couldn't ignore my bladder anymore. I had to pee very urgently and suddenly!

I took my backpack and my laptop, and headed to the library bathroom. Getting up, i felt an even stronger pee urge. I walked faster. When i got to the toilets, I saw a line for the only available single person toilet.

I was too embarrased to wait in line, so i rushed to the nearby physics building. I walked as fast as i could without running. I was bursting! I had a lot of coffee and was being too focused to notice the urge until it was an absolute pee mergency'!

When i got to the, thankfully empty, men's room, I hurried to the nearest urinal. I couldn't help squirming a little as i undid my pants. I held it way too long! I pissed a hard and desperate stream fot 40 seconds or so. Relief flooded over me as i pissed.
