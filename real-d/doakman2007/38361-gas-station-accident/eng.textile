I had been filling three 5 gallon gasoline cans for my lawn tractor. I had a severe urge to urinate when I pulled into the station, but even though I'm 75 years old with a problem with leakage, I thought I could fill the cans and get home before I began leaking. Unfortunately, I was wrong. By the time I had filled the second can, I was leaking. While filling the third can, I lost complete control. Although many people were at pumps around me, I don't think anyone noticed the stream running between my legs or the puddle in which I was standing.

You guys are my kind of people. By the way, Blisster, I was wearing black sport shorts, the kind that dry fast and don't show wetness. Also, I never wear underwear. Do you guys mind telling me how old you are and how you know my age? I haven't found birthdays in profiles.
