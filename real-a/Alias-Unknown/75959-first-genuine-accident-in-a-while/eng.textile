It was a relatively standard work day. Annoying customers and cleaning etc. at the end of my day i went home and got changed and went out to eat with my girlfriend. During our dinner i ended up needing to pee a bit but we were originally planning on heading straight home so I ignored it. My urge did progressively get worse though and after we got the bill I debated going to the bathroom but my omo brain said no u got this. The ride home was bad but not too serious, when we arrived back at my place my girlfriend made a dash for the bathroom because she knew I had to go >:/. She said if i could hold it 5 more minutes i could go. I took off my jacket and boots and did small little pee dances until i felt a short pain before my panties suddenly felt warm. I ended up having my first genuine accident in quite a while. She teased me afterwards too >:/.

Sorry for the very rushed story.
