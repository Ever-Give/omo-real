Short story from today. As a premise, I have a small bladder and I have never been really good at holding my pee since I was a child (countless accidents as a kid); real accidents do not occur to me if I do not want to, usually. I have had a few close calls during my adulthood and a partial involuntary wetting, but that’s it.

After lunch today I felt kinda dizzy, so I just took a nap. I woke up with a strong bladder ache, my underwear was a little wet. I was shocked because I have never wet the bed since I was a kid, but I ran to the bathroom. In my way to the toilet, however and much to my surprise, I leaked a lot, I could just not stop my bladder to release small spurts. Finally, I undressed to save my trousers and just let it go in my underwear, which was already soaked. Heavenly!

It was wonderful because it was completely unplanned, nowhere near an accident, just a good amount of leaking, but really hot!
