So earlier this day I reached my bladder's limit (the video is in the download section btw), so my holding ability was quite impaired.

Anyway I went to the gym and I was the only guest so I did my session while drinking lots of water and energy drink, at some point though it started to get really uncomfortable but I decided to ignore it by focusing on exercising.

Time passed by, the need getting more and more intense, gym machines are already torture devices usually but a bursting bladder really does make it worse !

I challenged myself to do certain number of reps to keep myself distracted from the desperation, it worked quite well until I started using the running machine, I could feel my bladder like a volleyball bouncing in my body.

When I stopped running the desperation hitted me and I almost peed myself, I managed to regain control and do a few more reps before heading to the sauna.

By then it was a matter of minutes before I flood my undies.

As I entered the sauna I put the timer on for 15 minutes and told myself "ok, you are not allowed to pee (of course) neither touch yourself before the end of the timer".

I had to use all my will and the power of all my muscles to keep the floodgates shut, still I was slowly dripping pee but at least I didn't totally lose control (I didn't want to pee in the sauna, it wouldn't be nice for the next guests !).

By the end of the the sand was moving so ridiculously slow while I was struggling like crazy not to pee all over the place, it was soo intense !

Time's out ! I made a dash to the shower and let it all go in my underwear, I was panting and shaking, what a relief !

I quickly cleaned my mess and went back to chill in the sauna.
