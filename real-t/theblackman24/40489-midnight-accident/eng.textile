Oneday I woke up in the middle of the night and I needed to pee really badly, my bladder was full to the brim and it was sore. went to the bathroom but the door was locked, my girlfriend was in their, she was very pissed at me for forgetting to pick her up at work. she said you made me wait for hours so you wait, (She knows I have a bad bladder) I told her I needed to pee and I cant hold it, she shouted, "so what you for got about me" and starts taking a shower. i knock on the door and beg her to let me in so I can pee but she was not having it, she said go away.

When I herd the shower water turn off I knocked on the door again and told her I couldn't hold it anymore and sorry for forgetting to pick you up. She didnt say anything, but my bladder started to give out and I started to leak into my pajamas. my bladder contracted hard and I started to wet my pajama pants I couldnt hold it . Naturally I cry when I cant hold and wet myself so I started crying. All of a sudden my girlfriend opens the door looks at me crying, all of a sudden she said sorry for making me pee myself and felt bad. She dosent know I have a pee fetish or automatically cry when I wet myself lol. idk if I can tell her i liked it, i dont want her to think im weird.
