Got super desperate on my cummute home today. As I left work, I needed to pee, but nothing too urgent, so I ignored it. I didn't feel like taking the crowded late afternoon bus, so I decided to walk home. It's about an hours walk, and the weather was nice. I wasn't worried about waiting until I got home to pee.

About 20 minutes later, it became urgent. I had to go really bad. I sped up a little. My belt was pressing on my bladder. The rest of the way home, I was dying for a pee.

I was absolutely desperate when I finally approached my apartment. Luckily, I was alone in the elevator. I crossed my legs and bent my knees. The elevator was taking forever. I had my keys ready before the elevator even stopped. I ran to my door, unlocked it, and went inside. I squirmed as I took off my shoes. When my shoes were off, I ran to the bathroom. I had to squeeze my crotch to keep my pee in when I stood in front of the toilet. I hurriedly undid my belt, unzipped, and finally took a long, relieving pee.

Lately, I've decided to not pee in public, except for at work. More often than not, i get home with a very full bladder.
