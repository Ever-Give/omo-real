Seems to me that a good deal of the omo world is centered around desparation and accidents.

Personally i'm more drawn to deliberate wetting for the sake of it. For relaxation if you will. As something planned or at least as a consious choise.

To me that's much more thrilling than having an unplanned and somewhat unwanted accident.

Am i in minority here?

I guess the thing is werther it's deliberate or unvoluntary. Wolking up a good hold, all the way to desparation and finally having to let it flow can be amazing. I do that alot myself. I've never fancied the "desperately trying open the door and having an accident" stuff much. Wetting should be fun. Short and simple.

I would go either way, sometimes the relaxation just feels a lot better after a real desperation. Sometimes peeing without desperation feels equally good.

Yes. I agree. I might have expressed myself a little clumsy. While reading the replies i've come to realise that it's really not so much about desperation, as that can be a part of the fun, but more about accidents that are not deliberate.

As a matter of fact i'm alone at home and i kinda "have to go" soon... I'm not nearly desperate though: Not yet... But that's another thread.
