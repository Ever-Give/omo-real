Went to the store yesterday and looked at the selections of pull-ups. I'm pretty petite, and I can't afford actual ABDL diapers, so I thought I'd just buy some Goodnites or something similar. Unfortunately, the large Goodnites didn't seem to have cute designs, so I went with something called Allnites. I was a little disappointed when I first tried them on- they were very tight and barely covered my butt. I didn't have high expectations, because they felt pretty thin. I started a hold, and when I decidded to wet the Allnite, wow. They held more than Depends and hardly leaked at all. Normally my bladder isn't that full when I wet, so they should be able to comfortably hold one wetting. I'm really, really pleased with them.
