I was writing stories on my net book while listening to music, so again my mind was fairly distracted. Normally I would be sitting on the couch when doing this, but last night I decided to sit on the floor with my net book on the coffee table. I had been so distracted by my music I didn't even realize I had to go to the bathroom until I fell that feeling you feel when your bladder muscles are about to release. But as i was about to try to get up, it gushed out really fast. My whole but was soaked with pee. the thing is, I actually sat there in my pee for a good 15 mins. before cleaning it up.
