There is no great story this time I'm afraid :p

Baisically I was chatting with someone yesterday on this site and unintentionally I was drinking quite a lot of water, after a while I began to feel my bladder filling up. So I decided to play a little game with myself.

I would wait for each reply and once I had gotten a reply I would then say to myself "okay next reply then you can go" and of course each reply i would do the same thing. This went on for a few hours and my bladder was full to burst. Then as I was waiting for one reply, it didn't arrive....

After 15 minutes of waiting I started to leak, so I ran to the bathroom to enjoy my accident and took a few pictures of the result of my little game :D

As I said not a great story, but it was certainly good fun for me :D$$
