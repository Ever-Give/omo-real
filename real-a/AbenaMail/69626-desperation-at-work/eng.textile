Hey!

First time posting on this part of the forum. Usually on the diaper experience part of it all.

I have had feelings and urges for wetting for a week or two and today was a good day to finally do it.

I was in work for the morning with usual weekly meetings. One meeting rolled in to two and then three. During the second meeting a felt the need to pee but knew it would stop soon and I would go between the meetings. This built my want to wet and I formed a plan.

I filled up my 1 litre water bottle and drank until nearly lunch time, I was growing more desperate and left for home a little earlier. Once I got moving my desperation wasn’t so much so went to office to talk with a few people, once I sat down my desperation increased and I continued to drink.

I left for home having some knee knocking and grabbing on the drive.

Pixture is from the leak as soon as I was in the door and the terrible video was during the wetting. I wasn’t able to get a great video as I was desperate.

Hope you enjoy. I plan on working from home diapered this afternoon.
