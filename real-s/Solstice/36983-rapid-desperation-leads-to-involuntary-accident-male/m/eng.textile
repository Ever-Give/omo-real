Decided to do a hold today with the rapid desperation technique and film the results like I do with most of my other holds. I ended up having my first involuntary accident in a long time!

My bathroom is across from my room more or less, so its not uncommon I let myself get really desperate during holds before going. That usually takes a while though so I misjudged how desperate I would get and how quickly, so by the time I ran for the bathroom I had to go so bad I was holding myself with one hand and filming with my tablet with the other.

Unfortunately for me, I had left the toilet lid down on my last visit, and although I managed to wiggle out of my shorts and underwear with no hands, I needed one to lift the lid. I thought I could let go of myself for a second and only lose a spurt or two, but as soon as I loosened my grip on my crotch pee started gushing out uncontrollably and due to my weakened bladder muscles I couldn't stop it at all until I was done.

I was peeing so much by this point it was basically water so it didnt smell and clean-up wasnt too bad lol. Still crazy how fast your bladder fills with that method though considering I had went less than 30 minutes before losing control.
