After peeing my leggings last night, I still really had to go, but it didn't hurt anymore so I kept holding. I changed into a soft grey bathrobe, and laid on the couch. My roommate was at the other end, and I laid on a big pillow in the middle so he couldn't see much of my body. We started watching a movie, and about an hour passed before I was desperate to pee again. Under my bathrobe, my turquoise panties were still dry, except for how aroused I was getting. I didn't have any time to touch myself after the earlier wetting.

I pressed my hand between my legs, completely hidden by my robe. I tried really hard to relax and pee in my underwear, but I just couldn't do it! My bladder ached and I could feel I was close, but my body wouldn't let me. I was insanely horny and wanted to feel myself wet again. I got up and grabbed a small towel from the bathroom closet. I shoved it between my legs and made sure it was hidden by my bulky robe. I carefully walked back to the couch and sat down, swiftly positioning the towel underneath me so I could still touch myself.

My heart was racing as I pressed my fingers to my clit. I moved them quickly and gently until I felt myself pissing through my underwear. It only lasted for a second before I regained control and immediately climaxed. I'm so glad I'm practiced at orgasming silently
