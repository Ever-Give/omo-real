I grew a custom of having a small bladder and sometimes not making it and wetting myself. I peed my pants and embarrassed myself so many times because of my small bladder , im immune to embarrassment from wetting myself so many times. Only thing is weird is I always cry when I cant hold my pee and wet myself.. when my bladder is very very full i just start crying. Last week I was at a mall with a full bladder like I couldn't wait, I was in the bathroom line and I was holding myself. I started to cry and pee in my pants infront of a crowd of people, I dont care for peeing my pants in front of people but I just start crying when I lose control. Do you cry when you lose control of your bladder? my small bladder sucks but i like it

I sometimes wish I had a small bladder. I can hold it forever and while that means I virtually never have to use public toilets and I never have accidents, it also means that when I want to pee myself it takes forever to get desperate enough to start leaking, and I have to drink a lot to get there.

When you have a small bladder, your bladder muscle wont be able to hold your pee back when it starts to contract. your bladder will contract so hard that it will overwhelm ur bladder muscle and you will pee yourself
