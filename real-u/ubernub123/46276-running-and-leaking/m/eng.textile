Running and Leaking

I did a 10k last Saturday and I did pretty good, considering I haven’t been able to train due to various circumstances.

I peed right when I got off work at 9:30 and I made it to the start line at around 9:55. The race began at 10:02 and about two or three minutes into the race...my bladder began to fill. I had some water before the race to keep myself hydrated, but now it was a problem. What’s worse is that this is a race with no portapotties and the race is on a road completely closed for business.

The urge for worse and the hottest part about the race is one woman running next to me mutters, “would it be frowned upon if I just peed myself?” That got my blood pumping. The color of her leggings would have been perfect if she wet...but after running with her for about twenty minutes...nothing. But the fantasy was great!

Back to me. No relief and my bladder got more full. I LOVE pissing myself, but in public like this...I’d rather not.

I can feel my tip in my shorts and I feel wet. I’ve never had this happen: I’m Leaking! The leak grew bigger and I knew that I had to hurry up so I could make it.

I sped up and made it to the finish line without peeing myself, but the ironic part is once I got to the finish line I didn’t have to go anymore.

When I got home, however, the floodgates opened and I peed a LOT.

Thought I’d share the time I ALMOST had a public accident
