It had been months

Living with other people can sometimes be hard, especially with a fetish like this and the need to be hush-hush about it (situational, etc.), but last month I finally got an opportunity to be by myself because everybody else living with me had errands to do.

So of course, I knew what I was going to do! I drank as much as my stomach would handle and I was sure to have some caffeine to get things moving around. I also figured that I should watch some omo videos while I waited for my bladder to fill up so I made sure to get in the spirit of things. The feeling of desperation increased.

I waited a while and I could pretty much feel my bladder stretching. After it became very painful, I decided to get into the shower and put the shower stool in it so i could relax while I enjoy my event.

My brain eventually decided that my body was done holding and my bladder gave way. I couldn't stop from going and i couldn't stop going. My undies were completely soaked by the end and I was completely relaxed. Relief!

Such a good moment. I hope I can get a chance here again soon :)
