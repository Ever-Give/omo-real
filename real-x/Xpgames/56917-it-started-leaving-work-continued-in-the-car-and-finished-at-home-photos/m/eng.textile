Here’s what I documented in real time..... hope you enjoy...

I’ve been on the phone for almost an hour and I actually have to pee pretty badly!!! I literally have about a 1 minute update to present, otherwise I’d hang up and call it a day!!! Ok damn I seriously have to go!!! Under normal circumstances I would have hung up 15 minutes ago I need to start thinking exit strategy.... ok I have to talk next....

OMFG talking REALLY made it worse!!! 5 more minutes!!! I’m currently sitting in some office trailers that do not have toilets (of Fing course)... walking to the main building is about 5 minutes out of my way ... I don’t know if I will make it... fuck it, I’m just going to head straight to my car and hope for the best OMFG!!!! My legs are shaking, I’m holding myself and if I don’t leave now, I’m seriously going to have an accident !!!! Did I mention that I am wearing gray chinos and any drop will show IMMEDIATELY???? Ok I’m shutting down my computer!!!! My forehead is sweating .... I have already given up on making it home before peeing my pants... I just hope I can make it all the way out of work!!!! Ok I have to run!!!

Holy fuck a huge spurt of piss escaped while walking to my car!! Hope security cameras didn’t catch that hahahaha I have a 20 minute drive and somehow that helped A LITTLE.... maybe a 9.9 is accurate!! It will be a minor miracle if I make it home without flooding my car seat!!!

SONOFA!!!!! Traffic is bad enough that I can type this while driving (stopped)!!! I just leaked again!! Starting to move...OMG I’m leaking into my pants at the traffic light!!!

Just parked on the street in front of my house!!! I CANT MOVE!!!!! OH NO!!! No! No! Nooooo!!!! OMG!!! OMG I’m going I’m going I’m going!!!!!!!! Fuck I can’t stop it!!!!! oh my god!!! You would not believe how much I just peed!!! I’m super soaked! There’s workers outside on the street!! Damn it! They are definitely about to see me!!!!! I still have to go!!!! Screw it... I’m running to the house...

I am in the house kicking off my shoes and running to the bathroom... I just jumped in the shower and completely pissed the rest of my pants fully flooding my socks too wow that was a lot of peeing!!!!!!

Thanks everyone! As if that was not intense enough for one day, I had a VERY close call a couple hours later on my kid’s soccer training.... they weren’t even halfway done and I had to go almost as bad as when I was leaving work .... I took advantage of a water break and sprinted across the field to the main building (which was locked of course)... I would have normally lost it right there but somehow held on and ran to the parking lot where I peed for a while next to my car... I could not wait one second longer!!! Was very lucky to make it and that no one was there to see what I did....
