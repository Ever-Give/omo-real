Hey everyone!

Last month I was walking through a very large, public park listening to music in the early evening (around 5 PM). Given how few people I encountered I decided to hold it until I became VERY desperate. I decided to enter a more densely wooded area and followed a winding trail up a hill. Spying a large log just off the point where three different trails intersected, I sat myself down and let loose

It's worth noting that I had a 5-minute walk (including through a much more open part of the park) until I got back to my car, which was parked right across the street from a bustling park pavilion. I didn't stop to see who may have seen me, but I think anyone gazing out from the pavilion would've seen my wet shorts.

Thanks @BladderLad

! I think this was my first public wetting of 2020, and certainly not the last. More videos to come!
