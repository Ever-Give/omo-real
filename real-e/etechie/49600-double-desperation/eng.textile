As I was on my way home today from work I could feel my bladder being really full, not only that but I also felt my bowels moving around as well. As I am getting out of my car I could really feel the pressure and as I was walking up to my condo I was struggling to hold it in, I made it inside , open the bathroom door, took off my pants and underwear, and I swear I peed for several minutes, before I could feel some relief, after that I was able to finally feel some relief, the I proceeded to perform the rest of the relieving,(I wont get into the rest of that here). But I think I barely almost made it.
