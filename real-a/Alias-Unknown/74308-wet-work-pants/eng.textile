Hello all, yesterday I had a bit of an oops after work. I work as a waitress so we tend to be forced to hold our bladders a good bit. Luckily I’ve never had an accident at work but it’s been close. Today I finished my shift and went outside to walk home. The restaurant I work at is actually quite close to my apartment so I’ve given up on driving there since it’s pointless. I’m sure most of you know what we wear but I had on the typical black work pants. The walk to my apartment is at most 15-18 minutes and I mostly enjoy it, just today I really really had to pee. After some internal brain fighting I figured i’d just wet myself since I had the next day off so I could wash the pants. So I stopped at the crosswalk before my apartment and fully wet myself, i made a cute puddle too so even though it wasn’t visible on my pants, anyone who saw me probably knew what was going on.
