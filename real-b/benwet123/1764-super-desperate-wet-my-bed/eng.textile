I had an exam at school today so had the rest of the day off from 10:00. I got home and immediately started chugging water. Within roughly an hour, i was super desperate, literally couldn't sit still at all, my bladder hurt so bad. So I put on my pajamas and laid in my bed for a while, still figiting. Then I decided to just let it out. Soaked my bed and pj's pretty bad, I then put the sheets in the washer.

Haha, sounds like fun. I've never wet my bed before because I would personally find it annoying to have to wash all the bedsheets, but it still sounds fun. Was the mattress soaked as well?

My mattress has a waterproof sheet on it. Don't really know why because, my mum has never caught me wetting the bed before. So I guess i'm just lucky that the sheet my mum bought is waterproof. So no the mattress wasn't soaked. to be honest, as long as i am on my own, the clean up is no more annoying than washing clothes.
