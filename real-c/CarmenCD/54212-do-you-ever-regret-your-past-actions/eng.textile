Do you ever regret your past actions after you have a wetting accident or even after you wet your self on purpose?

It happened to me numerous times already and I said I won't do it again, but next time I do it again. Like today. I didn't use a bathroom before leaving work and try to hold it on the way home, even I knew I'll have to stop in a grocery shop. I often hold it on a way home, but I go straight home and usually nearly make it. Due to detour today, I came home with a wet patch down to my knees, because small leaks became big leaks before I reached safety of my home. And it was not one of my night time excursion all masked up as a lady, not really worrying much how many people notice my indiscretions. I was still in my work clothes. I was wearing a coat, but a few people noticed my wet pants anyway.
