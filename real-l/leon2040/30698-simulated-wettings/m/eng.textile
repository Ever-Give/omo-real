Simulated "Wettings"

It's clearly not the same as an honest soaking, but (as I'm doing right now) sometimes sticking a Styrofoam coffee cup over myself and holding back until it gushes out into the cup is rather nice. Close enough for government work, without additional mess (which is handy in some instances...like typing a paper that's due tomorrow by midnight)

The bladder pressure (depending on how I'm sitting), the sensation of almost leaking, the shock when that first spray coming shooting out...

Case in point, been holding like this for about ninety minutes. Legs are "crossed" (as crossed as they can be with a 24oz coffee cup covering my junk), knowing any second I'm going to start involuntarily.

Anyone else do something similar, or does this kind of "Cheapen" it for you?

Edit: Went not long after posting. Cup is nearly filled, and from the sound of it, I'm surprised I didn't put a hole in the bottom.

If I want the feeling of a wetting, but just don't have the time or energy to deal with wet clothes, I'll usually just stand in the shower and tightly cup my junk with my hands and press my legs together and let go like that. Obviously nowhere near as good as a real wetting, but still feels really nice.

One personal benefit of being a "grower," I can do along those lines as well as retract in a bit. Makes for a strong stream.
