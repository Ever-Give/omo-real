If you are like me you don't like getting up during the movies to pee especially if its one with your favorite actor or actress. I am not into actual diapers, but have disvored depends like underwear, comfortable and absorbent. saw an ad for a free mailing and sent away for it. i wore them to the movies a few weeks ago and it was great. I could just sit there and wet myself and not worry about getting the seat wet and people seeing wet pants because they were so well . I wet them twice during the movie full of people and no one would ever know expect me. its so great. Ive been wearing them not only to movies but just in public in general, dont have to worry about finding a bathroom. i can wet myself in public and no one is the wiser
