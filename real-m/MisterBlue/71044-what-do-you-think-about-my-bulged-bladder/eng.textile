So I've finaly had another chance to do some hold. I'm alwas making photos when I'm holding. Today I've decided to post all of them here (latest are from today (at the top)). For you and also to have answer the title question. I will be grateful for any opinion and will answer (or at least try) all questions if I woun't have good reason to not answer. Also becose of limitations of my account, I will post second part.

No. I don't know my capacity. It's really difficult to do holds and will be next few years. So I'm trying to enjoy it as much as I can when I get a chance (I do enjoy taking those photos). But when I'll have more freedom and privacy I'll definitelly measuri it. But as I said, it will have to wait few years.

I approve and would like to pet it gently, like a cat. How desperate would you say you felt when these were taken?

8/10 - 9/10. Thats why it's so shaky.
