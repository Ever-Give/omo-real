Hey guys. Once again its been a while. Lately I've been visiting the site and just 'lurking' but not really partaking in any omo fun. That changed on a whim today. Lately ive been on a detox kick, trying different supplements, etc. This morning I drank a large mug of dandelion root tea, roughly 24oz worth and got the idea in my head to break in some of my newer pairs of jeans that I've never wet in. So that just what I did. I waited desperately til I had the house to myself, sat in a cast iron chair outside on our patio and released my bladders contents. I'd forgotten how the tea made it so much harder to hold just a small amount of pee. see pics below.

I have another pair of jeans to 'break in' so I'm gonna do a longer hold. Seeing as I have lots of empty smart water bottles laying around, I'll be using those to measure intake. I may record a video of the wetting as well if anyone would like to see it. I'm not a particularly attractive or skinny girl...as you can probably tell...

I just figure its about time to give back, ya know.

Just finished wetting a second time. cant seem to hold back for a long time anymore. It was a bigger wetting this time and the relief was amazing!
