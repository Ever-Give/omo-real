My commute home from work took a little longer than normal yesterday due to a bunch of inconveniences. I was tapping my foot in the elevator up to my flat and leaked just a little bit in my butterfly panties right before I made it to the toilet at home.

Unfortunately life is a little to busy for me to go into too much detail, but you can all imagine a slightly desperate Rachel on the SkyTrain, right?

What about imagining a bursting Rachel rooted to the spot, her face growing an increasingly brilliant shade of magenta, utterly defenseless as she pees her pants? Despite her valiant last ditch effort to hold back, darkening fabric racing down her legs, and blooming right under the cheeks of her butt as her bladder takes control. Meanwhile, a soft hissing from her crotch, and and pitter-patter on the floor of the Skytrain heard as a puddle forms at her feet?

Okay I'm done,

A friend of mine has a water closet (just toilet and sink) immediately beside the front door at her house, where a coat closet would normally be. It was like that when she bought the place so I can only imagine that the previous owner must have had a terrible case of keyhole syndrome!
