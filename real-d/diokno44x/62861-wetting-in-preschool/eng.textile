I remember this one small incident in preschool. One of my diaperless moments.

I remember I was playing with some toys cars when I felt a need to pee. Normally I'd have just gone, but as I had changed ouf of the last spare diaper I had, that was out of the option. I went over to one of the TAs, and I told her "I gotta potty." She said yes, and I went to the nearby preschool bathroom. However, as I was heading there, one of my classmates headed inside. One, of the reasons for my diapers was to prevent accidents due to a lack of comfortability when in bathrooms with other people aside from a relative in it, especially public bathrooms.

Clutching myself, I began to let my bladder go as I walked back to the toys I had been playing with
