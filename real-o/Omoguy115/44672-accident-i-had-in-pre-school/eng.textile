Alright so back in pre school I was really shy and didn’t really like interacting with people except my close friend. So this one time I had to pee but I didn’t want to ask the teacher I was to scared. Eventually I finally decided to ask for the bathroom and she say yes. When I go to the bathroom I couldn’t undo my belt so I went back and drawed up all my Courage and asked the teacher to undo my belt while she was doing it tho I completely peed my pants. From that day for the rest for my pre school days I never wore belts again
