OK so two days ago I was playing overwatch at my apartment and I got really into the game and played until past the point where why would normally go to the bathroom. I did this for two major reasons one I was enjoying myself to much a two because my restroom was not working so in order to take a pee break I had to go to the apartment laundry room and use the restroom there. I was just wearing some old plain grey PJ shorts and a red Nike shirt while I was in the middle of Hollywood assault as D.va and my urge hit me. I didn't want to leave mid match because of the leavers penalty and I thought I could make it because our team was practically crushing them, but as it turned out we were more equally matched than I thought.

I was bursting to pee at this point when I wasn't focused on killing my enemies I had to put it all on my bladder to stop potential leaks. I did not plan to wet myself that day kinda just a happy accident. I lost control \ gave in when I had to remove my hand from my crotch to kill some enemies when I was walking back from spawn. I still remember the sensational feeling of the warm pee collecting on the bottom of my shorts. This is probably one of if not my favorite wettings since it was somewhat genuine which makes it all the more pleasurable to me. Please comment if you feel the same and what I could to improve my writings
