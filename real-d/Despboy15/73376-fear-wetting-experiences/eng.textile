Has anyone peed themselves out of fear?

When I was in high school I was exploring this abandoned building by myself and had already been super desperate a little while before, so my bladder was still weak. I heard a noise and I turned around. I don’t remember what it was, but I do remember that I felt a warmth in my shorts and realized I had an accident.
