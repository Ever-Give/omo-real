I wonder why she had to go so badly before asking that she couldnt wait another 20 minutes.. Maybe she has a health issue..

She looks relatively young now. And this was 5 years ago. It could easily have just been caffeine and one missed opportunity before trial.

The judge definitely looks like someone who would enjoy denying bathroom breaks. Looks like someone Id love to be denied by too. She actually checked the seat for urine afterwards.

I remember reading this one a while back. Even as a straight dude that finds these kinds of things extremely hot (in the right time and place, that not being one of them), I can't help but feel for her! There's no hiding that one... The sterile silence of the courtroom being interrupted by the unmistakable splashing of piss pouring on to the carpet of the courtroom floor.... I know we're all in to this kind of stuff but man, publishing it right in the news? Kind of a dick move I'd say. Ruthless! I hope she's doing okay after all that.

Never thought about the sound lolol. But she’s actually doing really well, owns her own law firm now. The conspiracy theorists in me says maybe she did all that on purpose to somehow help with her defense case (The judge said she checked the chair for wetness)
