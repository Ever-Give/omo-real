I got up too late and the school bus is gonna be there in 5 mins. and I haven't peed since last night... Anyway, I gotten dress and the bus was there. Oh the pain of a full bladder, the bus was shaking, making it so much harder to hold it in. "Ooh...gotta go..." I thought. The bus driver still have to pick-up 4 more student and one student is in a wheelchair. I started to leak a bit. "No...It started to come out..." I thought, luckily I was wearing navy blue pants. Holding myself, squirming, fidgeting and started to cry a little bit.

Finally made it to the school. I've somehow managed to hold it and made it the boy's room (without showing any symptoms). Went to the urinal, unzip, and started to go. "Ahh, finally... relief..." said to myself. But the bell started to ring and I was still peeing. So I decided to finish peeing. Of course I was a bit late to class and I gotten a warning, since it was my first time being late. I really don't care, at least I didn't wet myself (at least, not in a public place. Heh Heh.)

Then of course, I have to go pee every period, since my bladder a bit weak...*blush*

I could never understand getting up late and not going at home. It takes less than 2 minutes.
