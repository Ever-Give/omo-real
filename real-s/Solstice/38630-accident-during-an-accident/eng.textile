Accident during an accident

I had been holding my pee for a while and decided to wet myself and record it to upload here. I wanted to hold it until I genuinely lost control, but I planned to be in the bathtub when that happened to minimize cleanup.

Instead I started losing control suddenly in my room, so I grabbed my phone with one hand and held myself with the other as I rushed to the bathroom so I wouldn't wet the carpet.

I didn't count on the toilet lid being down. With one hand recording and the other being the only thing stopping my pee, I couldn't lift the lid (should have used my foot in retrospect but was too desperate to think straight.)

I decided if let go of myself for a second just to lift the lid I would be ok. But the second I let go, pee burst out forcefully into my underwear and I couldn't stop it at all.

Unfortunately my bladder giving way must have affected my stomach somehow because as I stood there peeing myself, poop suddenly squirted out noisily into my underwear. I hadn't even felt the need to go #2 and I definitely wasn't planning to film that. I was frustrated my video got ruined by me messing so I just said screw it and emptied the rest of my bladder onto the floor since I was going to have to clean it anyways.

Odd and unwanted outcome for me but thought I'd share.
