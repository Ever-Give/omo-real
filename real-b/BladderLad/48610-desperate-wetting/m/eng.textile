After the mammoth hold I did this morning my bladder muscles were really strained! Got really cold walking the dog and came really close to losing it in the garden hosing him. Thought the track pants I was wearing would look really good wet, however they are new so sadly not very absobant

Yeah- I know the feeling; you have a pair of pants that may feel great to wet, but really don't show the spread as well. I hope it felt good in any case!

It felt amazing! It was a massive piss, just a shame it wasn’t visible! Lol
