It certainly is magical peeing in zero gravity. I was camping on a remote island this past summer, and every morning I would go down the cliff to the waters edge, strip down naked, and just float there in the silence; naked and aroused, and relax my bladder. I have to pee really bad in the morning, so just floating there, peeing, and watching as my sexual anatomy stiffened...oh...

Should you ever have the opportunity, I can't stress this further. Do try it...

But naked peeing is the best! Well, in my own opinion. I prefer to see where the pee is coming from ;) And not much beats lying down in the tub with a girl standing over top of you, releasing her bursting bladder and feeling the warmth of it as her hot pee cascades down and splashes onto your chest.
