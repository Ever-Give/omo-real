Quick Laxative Fun

Got bored late at night, and remembered I had a few suppository laxatives left. These are the stimulant kind, and they kick in within 5-10 minutes for me.

I decided to have a little fun, so I put on an old pair of underwear, put in a laxative, and sat down. I put on a 20 minute YouTube video, hoping to hold it until it was done (spoiler alert, I didn't).

The thing about stimulant laxatives is that the desperation gets intense, and FAST. Within five minutes I was squirming back and forth as my tummy started to gurgle. I needed to go, and my body didn't want me to forget that.

I wanted to wait out the video, but a big cramp hit me, and I knew I wasn't going to last. I ran up the stairs to the bathroom, and the desperation only got more intense. I didn't want to give in right away, wanted to tease myself a little bit more before I got my relief. I took off my pants and underwear (which weren't completely clean!) and stood in front of the open toilet, hopping from foot to foot.

My stomach was growling and I could feel my #2 poking at my backside, but I wanted to hold it as long as possible. Unfortunately, that's when my bladder decided to remind me that it was full too. I raced to sit down as I started peeing, and immediately pushed out two huge logs after it. I ended up sitting on the toilet for 20 minutes as cramps washed over me.

I have to wash my underwear now
