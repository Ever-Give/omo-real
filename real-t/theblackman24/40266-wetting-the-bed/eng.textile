When I was young I had a terribly bad bladder. One night I got home and I was so tired I could barely stay awake, I needed to pee but not badly. I drunk a bottle of 7 up and I feell a sleep shortly after. I remember I was dreaming about being a gardener, and I was I was growing plants. I turned on the water holes to water the plan andI remember felling A watery feeling in my pants. All of a sudden I woke up and I was peeing myself in the bed, I tried to stop it but the pee kept coming out and wetting my pants and the bed. I grabbed myself but the pee kept coming out and I soaked my bed. When i emptied my bladder I started to cry because I wet my bed.

Your like my brother lol My bladder was so weak when I was younger I would wake up peeing the bed and I couldnt stop it. My mom took me to the doctor, and I was diagnosed with a small bladder, so Im slightly retarted which is okay lol. Like you some times Id wake up with a full bladder and try to run to the bathroom. A lot of the times I couldnt make it and I would pee myself and I would soak my sweat pants. @richard2
