Hey! I don't normally post stories of myself holding/wetting, let alone a video, so enjoy this one!

God I have no idea how to start these. I woke up today at about 9:30, with a pretty full bladder; unusually full, in fact. I held it through my online class past 12, and then went downstairs to drink a bunch of water so i could fill my bladder up super full. Over the next few hours I kept holding and holding, enjoying the slowly intensifying feeling of pressure inside me.

By about 3 I was really full, I could touch my belly and feel my hard bladder poking through. At this point I couldn't sit still at all, I tried and tried to relax for a bit but i was so full and so excited that I just couldn't. I had to actively use my pelvic floor muscles to hold it all in, and I was so horny my heart was racing. By 3:30 I couldn't hold it anymore, and took my phone with me to the bathroom. And, well... the video should speak for itself. I hope you enjoy the view
