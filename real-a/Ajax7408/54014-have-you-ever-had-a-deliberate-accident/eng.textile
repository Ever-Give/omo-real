So I had a dream that I was back in high school and I was really desperate to pee but no-one was allowed to go to the bathroom and eventually I got so desperate I was on the verge of exploding but I was secretly loving it. By the time everyone was due to leave class I stood up and emptied my bladder into my jeans full force. Squelching, hissing and everything and I was loving every second of it. When I woke up it turned out to be a wet dream hehe but has anyone here ever had a pretend accident while secretly enjoying the fact that you completely peed yourself on purpose but nobody could tell?
