Obviously you have the wet clothes and any pee left on the chair/floor. Personally in the earlier school days having a plastic bag on your peg/by your desk was a tell tale sign as well as ill fitting clothes if they were provided by the school. Even in the later days of primary the plastic bag remained a tell tale sign but wearing gym clothes outside of gym was also a good indicator of a potential accident. In secondary it was borderline impossible outside of a direct sighting (only 1 for me) and once or twice a year a rumor spread about someone. Does anyone else have any indicators of an accident outside of a direct sighting?
