As an old timer (75), I frequently have to pee at night, sometimes 2 to 4 times. I have two replaced hips and a knee that has been replaced twice, so I don't get around very well. To avoid having to get up and go to the bathroom, I keep a large plastic jug by my bed to pee in. I can turn over on my side, pee, and be back asleep in a matter of a couple of minutes.
