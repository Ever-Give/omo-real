So I usually only wet the bed like once or twice a month maybe, but its happened twice in the past three days. I woke up Friday morning, and felt the familiar sensation of a wet bed. I didn't even wake up in the middle of the night when it happened. I just opened my eyes in the morning, and felt cold and wet...not the best way to wake up

Right now, I just woke up and yet again I'm wet. Still wearing my wet clothes and sitting in my wet bed while writing this. Didn't wake up until my alarm went off. Now, this can be pretty enjoyable at times, losing bladder control at night and all, but it can be a lot of work scrubbing my pee pad and changing my sheets. I haven't had to wear diapers for this for a couple of years, but now I'm starting to consider it again. We'll see what happens. I just hope my day problems don't come back, too.....
