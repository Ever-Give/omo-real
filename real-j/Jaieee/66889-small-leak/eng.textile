I've been busy with work this week, but I've also been allowed to work from home in the afternoon. The weather's nice, so I decided to work out in the yard. I wouldn't say I had to pee urgently, but the need was definitely noticeable. I needed to fill the watering can, so I brought it into the kitchen. As soon as I turned on the water, I immediately leaked a tiny bit, not even enough to feel wet on my underwear. I quickly grabbed myself between the legs and shut the after off. I decided I would water later!

I went back outside and pulled some more weeds, but I couldn't help but think about my involuntary "almost" accident. The thought of it aroused me. I don't often get so desperate I lose control, so it was really hot feeling like I couldn't hold it. Then I decided I would challenge myself to hold it while the water was going.

I did my best to not hold myself, and sure enough, I couldn't stop myself from wetting with the water running.

Next time I'll try it with a full bladder
