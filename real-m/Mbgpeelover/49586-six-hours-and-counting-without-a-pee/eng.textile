It’s been such a busy day with so many phone calls, emails and other stuff that I just haven’t even had a minute to pee!

I’ve had three mugs of tea so far and now I am typing this bursting for release. I can feel my bladder hard, my legs fidgeting about and my vagina tingling for attention.

My to do list still has a few things left so I will try get those done first before I go.

This is me right now.

Hi everyone sorry I posted and ran. I had an appointment but prior to going to it I made a video that I will upload to my xtube tonight (helpmehold is my user name there)

I read the poem I wrote last week and em...it was too long and I ended up having an accident.
