Today 2 of  my freinds and I had this amazing idea for the opposite of a holding contest. There are only 3 rules.

Rule 1. Completely empty your bladder before you start (optimal if you haven't been drinking for at least an hour when this happened s.

Rule 2. Start a timer right after the last drop leaves your body.

Rule 3. The pee, have to take at least 3 seconds. A few drops doesn't count.

Our times.

Megan: 42min 56 sec

Me: 38min 11 sec

Jennifer: 27min 9sec

Can anyone beat us, and go faster ?

Sadly I can see a flaw in this contest. When I wake up basically every morning, I have to pee like crazy!!! But, my first pee of the day cannot possibly totally empty my bladder to zero - though I often wish it would. Then, I head to make coffee and drink a pretty large cup (about 20ozs.) in the next 10-15 minutes. Usually, I feel the need to pee again pretty soon after that. And, when peeing this second time in the morning, it isn't just a tiny pee - it is usually same duration and volume as the first pee in the AM. Sadly, I hate to admit, it is just a matter of biology/physiology for those of us reaching an age when the prostrate has grown larger and prevents us from literally emptying the tank 100%. <sad-faced>.

Then after you've finished your coffee, hold it for and hour, pee and then start
