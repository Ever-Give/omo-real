So,,, I did a hold where I drank 500mL every hour for 8 hours and held all my pee.

This didn't work exactly as planned. I got desperate and I wanted to hold till the end, I started leaking a bit, and so I peed about 100mL and kept holding and kept drinking.

Unknowingly, only relieving a little bit of my bladder made holding harder, so I had to keep going back to release a couple mLs of pee every couple hours to keep myself dry....

Once I got home I burst. I tried to hold for longer but my poor bladder definitely got weakened by all that stop and start peeing.... So I only held about a liter of piss when I finally had my accident. I'm definitely going to go for just chugging water next time to get to my 2L capacity goal!!! My current record is 1.5L.

My maximum is 1.25 liter and 31.5 hours.

For me it is easier, to drink less and hold it longer. This way my bladder has more time to stretch and I love the feeling of a strong urge to pee for many hours.

Ooh, same,, but my bladder just isn't strong enough to hold for all those hours. Must have felt sooo good to release all that pent up piss after so long...
