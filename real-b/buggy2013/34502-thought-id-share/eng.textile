Overflowed a large McDonald's cup this morning. Can't see the puddle too well on the tile so I'm adding the sopping towel. Not even my best, just woke up full and thought I'd measure since it's been a while. I guess I need a bigger cup!

^ a bit, yeah. I know I have a large bladder and it was my morning pee, but I didn't think it was quite that much!
