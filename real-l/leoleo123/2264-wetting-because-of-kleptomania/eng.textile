Wetting because of kleptomania :)

One of my most interesting wetting sightings wasn't really a "sighting".

I was 6 years an overheard my aunt talking to my mother. My aunt had kleptomania. And this time she thought she got caught and wet herself with alarm. Nobody noticed as she was wearing a skirt and it was running down her legs into her boots (it was autumn).

Of course I've seen other kids wet themselves. But a grown up woman, I thought this rather interesting.
