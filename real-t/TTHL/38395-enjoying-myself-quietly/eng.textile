Welp, my story goes like this, when I was little me and the neighbor girl used to go around and find weird places to pee and ever since then iv always been aroused by it, me being a pretty straight and narrow guy, thats one of the few things I keep a secret. One thing iv been doing recently (I made a vow on my 18th to try new things) is taking old hand towels, adding them to underwear and going little bits here and there. Im still pretty shy about the whole thing but im really likeing it lol. Sucks to have nobody to talk about it with though xD

Taking old hand towels and peeing in them is a really nice way to start! It's fun to experiment.

Well you can talk about it on here anyway. I suspect that for many here this is the only place it gets talked about. I myself have only discussed it with two people I know in the real world in over 30 years.

Im defiantly happy to have found this place, been a lurker but decided why not become a part of it.

Real men start it by leaking to their underwear straight away. That's what I did.

At the moment I'm sitting on a towel which is on top of a plastic sheet. I've wet my pants, and I'm waiting for the next bladderful while I type this..
