So maybe this will turn into nothing, but I just want everyone's opinion on what the difference is.

I like everyone's opinions so far, lol. They makes sense.

I'm not really sure. I guess if I'm truly desperate, I never actually have just a leak then. It's always studded and forceful, because my bladder is dying for release.

If I'm just leisurely wetting then I guess that's when I leak, because I'm controlling it?

A leak flows at very low velocity — it trickles out, likely by accident, and maybe while you’re trying to stop it (or at least trying to keep it small and controlled). A spurt comes out at near-full velocity, but only for a moment. It’s “pinched off” almost as soon as it’s released. A spurt could be by accident, if caught by surprise, but it could just as easily be intentional. I would say the next step up from a spurt is a gush. A gush would be just like a spurt, except with a second or two of free-flow between the opening and pinching-off of the floodgates.

So, to describe it in bad ascii art:

Leak: .....

Spurt: (!!!)

Gush: (!======!!)

Thanks for your explanation, lol.
