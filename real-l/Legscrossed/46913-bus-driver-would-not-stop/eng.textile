I got pretty desperate for a pee on my last inter city bus ride. I barely made the bus in time, so i did not stop my a toilet. Had to pee slightly, but was not worried. It was an hour and a half, i could wait. An hour in, we hit some traffic. At this point, my bladder was very full. A woman asked the driver to pull into a gas station. He refused, saying he was behind schedule. I had to go really bad, but I didn't bother asking him, knowing he would say no.

I disracted myself with games on my phone. Over the nexy half hour, my need became an emergency. At this pace, it would take another 40 mins to arrive.

The rest of the journey, i was bursting. I even put my coat in my lap, because i was getting an urgency boner.

When the bus stopped, i hurried to the men's room. I had an immensely relieving piss at the urinal.
