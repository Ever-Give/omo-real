I seen many stories about desperation on a plane, and even some of desperate stewardess but never anything about desperation of a gate agent. they usually have to stand at the gate making sure people don't come through and would have to make sure all the tickets are scanned. they have limited time windows to run off to the bathroom.

Link me if anything found, could be fanfiction or real stories.
