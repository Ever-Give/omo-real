My Little "Problem" Returns

Our guys were home from work during "Aussie Day" so we decided we would travel to a nearby city to watch the fireworks that night to celebrate.

We had booked rooms in a motel within walking distance of the foreshore where the night spectacular was going to take place to avoid drinking and driving .

In the afternoon the guys took us to lunch, bought us wine while we relaxed and took in the atmosphere of our national day.

At night we moved down close to the foreshore to get a good vantage point to where we could set up and party while we watched the nights proceedings.

By now Lauren and I were feeling a little tipsy, but still in control . I think the guys had planned for us to get drunk anyway as we both have reputations to play hard. Maybe there was also an Altera motive for later in the night, which neither of us really needed any persuading to perform anyway.

By now I had also set about wearing a path to the " Portaloos " set up for the grand occasion, alcohol goes straight through me, especially since we had both switched to beer with the guys.

The night was a huge success as we were treated to a beautifully choreographed display of brilliant bursts of colour , punctuated by the crowd gasping in amazement as the sky lit up for miles around .

Eventually it was all over, we gathered up our stuff and set off for our motel rooms.

I really needed to pee but standing at the line waiting to use the Portaloos didn't do much for me, so I decided to risk walking back to our room with a full bladder. I knew my decision was fraught with danger, I didn't really want to piss my pants in front of my best friend and her partner so I walked and held on like grim death all the time trying to ignore my frantic urgency.

We made it back to our rooms although I was sure I had leaked a little bit on the walk .

Matt had noticed how desperate I was and true to form took his sweet time opening the door . I was glued to the spot, hunched over with both my hands pressing into my pussy through my jeans to avoid the impending flood of pee down my legs .

Matt's next move caught me totally by surprise. Thinking I had right of way to the bathroom because I was on the verge of wetting my pants, I had slowly walked little baby steps expecting to go first, but no ! my self serving partner had decided that he should go first and seeing he has a bladder the size of a race horse I was forced to wait . My partner happily made comments of how good it felt to pee and what a relief it was . The situation of hopelessness and listening to Matts stream hit the water started me giggling . I called him a " wanker" and resigned myself to the fact that the glistening wet spot growing in between my legs was not going to stop anytime soon as I stood helplessly as pee flooded my jeans filled my shoes and puddled around my feet .

Matt had deliberately made me piss my pants !! I began to think of revenge as I showered. I dried myself and put on my satin shorty pyjamas as if to get the message across that sex was not on the menu tonight for making me wet myself .

Who was I trying to kid !!! My resolution lasted all of 30 seconds . I dropped my diaper and plastic pants beside our bed and thinking "cow girl" climbed on top of Matt .

We didn't need foreplay, I ripped my satin shorts to one side and settled myself onto his "man toy" OMG ............. Matt had inadvertently fired my desire by making me piddle myself . We made love , I took my now subsided anger out on his chest as I drove my nails into him hoping I would make him bleed !!!

All was forgiven, I lay beside him panting, both of us totally spent . I reached over to give him one last cuddle before putting my diaper and plastic on then beddybyes .

I had the stupidest dream.

I dreamt that we were still watching the fireworks and I needed to pee . There were no toilets, which was totally bizarre considering there were people everywhere . So I decided to go over to the foreshore and jump in and pee clothes and all .

As I stood up Matt stuck his finger through one of the belt loops on my jeans to stop me going, so I went to slap it away. I couldn't get his hand off , so I was sort of " moon walking " on the spot still trying to get to the foreshore to wee.

Eventually I broke free and got to the water and jumped in . I remember , water , water everywhere then I peed . The relief was amazing !! it was so warm, I remember sighing in relief at the beautiful warm wet sensation that had now swallowed me up .

I awoke !!! Matt was shaking me.

Sel ................ you have pissed the bed !!!

Still groggy from sleep I tried to ignore him not wanting to believe what he had just told me, until my hand wandered down ............. and I felt wet everywhere . Then I smelt it !!

I turned on the light . I hadn't just wet it , I had drowned our bed, my pajamas and Matt as well, but where was my nappy . I looked over the side of my bed and there it was, right where I left it . We were both that tired from our day and making love that neither of us thought me putting my night diaper on !!

Part of me smiled inside, revenge is sweet !! but part of me also knew I had to confess to reception that I had peed myself in one of their beds .

If there is anything that annoys me about my occasional bedwetting problem its this. Doing it in someone else's bed !!!

I got up and showered, stripped the pissy sheets off and hoped the bed had a waterproof mattress protector . It didn't !! So the mattress now had my pee stain on it . Terrific !!

We packed up and I went down to reception to book out . I was dreading it, I waited until everyone had booked out before me then worked up the courage to make my embarrassing confession .

Ummmmmmm , I had a little accident " I said trying to hide my now ever reddening face

" What did you break " said the receptionist in a suitably professional manner .

" I wet my bed "

She looked at me as if I had just ridden in on a straw broom !!

OMG this is not going well

"Oh ............ umm , I will have house keeping take care of it " she seemed to realise just how embarrassing it was for me to admit to being an adult that wets the bed .

" Next time you stay please tell us and we make arrangements to help you with your problem "

I said thanks and hoped she was truthful .

So ended our celebrations , but I couldn't help wondering if she would have told all her friends who probably had a really good laugh at my expense.

Maybe next time I will be a little bit more careful

Yeah I will never learn !! no matter how many times I drink and wee the bed, I can still manage to stuff up one way or the other and end up doing it again

Occasionally Matt will pee himself for me, but I rarely get to see him desperate . I am still working on that part with him. He does love me peeing on him though and of course he loves making me wet my pants. Its a domination thing we have going that Matt has introduced me to that I have grown to love. As a couple we are still a work in progress, we explore other kinks as well which is also fun .

The embarrassment I can get over , its not the first time its happened and probably not the last

Matt made himself scarce, and left me to deal with the embarrassing bit at reception. Matt wasn't too angry even though he did get peed on, it wasn't the way he usually prefers
