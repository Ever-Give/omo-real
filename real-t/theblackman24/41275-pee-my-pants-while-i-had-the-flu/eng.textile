Background, I have a small bladder so I cant hold it very long. I few week ago I got very sick with the flu virus so I was literally bed bound for a few days. I went to CVS to get some cough medicine, when I was their I asked to use the bathroom and they told me it was for employees only. That is understandable but it took forever to get their due to traffic and I drank a lot of water so my bladder was full. I asked them to please make an acception, but they still said no. I picked u my cough medicine and drove home good thing their was no traffic on the way back so I got home fast.

When I got home I parked the car I felt my bladder giving out and I started leaking into my pants. I grabbed myself as hard as I could and stop the pee flow then walked to my house. When I got into my house I walked towards my bathroom, but when i was in my kitchen my bladder contracted really hard. The pressure was so hard that it hurt really bad to to grip myself and i lost my grip and the pee started gushing out into my sweat pants. I lost full control of my bladder the pee soaked my pants and I made a huge puddle in my kitchen floor.
