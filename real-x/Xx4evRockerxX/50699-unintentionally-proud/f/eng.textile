I was at work today just going about my day when I started to feel the need to go. As per usual, I was in a big meeting with probably 40 other people including a few of the Leadership. Not the time to go.

An hour and a half later, the meeting finally ended and while I had to go, it was certainly not urgent. It honestly wasn’t even a hold. It was just a delayed wee.

I went to the ladies room with another woman from a different department. We went into stalls next to each and both began going about he same time.

She finishes and leaves the stall to wash her hands. I’m still going.

She finishes washing her hands and adjusts her makeup a little in the mirror. I’m still going.

Another woman walks in a starts going as that first woman leaves. I’m still going.

The second woman finishes and leaves the stall to wash her hands. I’m still going.

The second woman finishes washing her hands and leaves. I finally finish.

While it was a bit of a weak stream today as I haven’t been drinking much water and wasn’t particularly pushing or anything, I was still just a little proud.

Made me feel like I had a proper monster bladder.

Anybody ever have that feeling? Makes your day just a little bright
