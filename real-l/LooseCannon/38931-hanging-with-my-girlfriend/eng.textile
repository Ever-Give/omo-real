Not important to the story but im female and bisexual. This happend a few nights ago.

Me and my girlfriend, we'll call liebe (any german speakers?) We were on the couch, i was watching tv and liebe was asleep with her head resting on my lap. And i started to look at her, admire her (its not creepy...) and i realized that her bladder seemed to be distended, full, and i got a mischievous idea. I put my hand were her bladder is and pushed slightly, not much happed. She adjusted her position slightly, a sure sign of discomfort, but overall nothing. Im going to try again i thought for science... i put my hand back above her bladder and pushed harder. Liebe's eyes shot open, and she got up and rushed to the bathroom, all the while giving a little worried squeak. A few minutes pass and liebe comes back from the bathroom, i asked her what had happened and she says "i nearly wet my self in my sleep!" She spreads her legs to show her inner thighs and crotch to reveal a large wet spot had formed, and their was a few drops on the couch too.

Thanks for reading this, its a little short i know but my "experiment" didnt lead any were... for science of course.
