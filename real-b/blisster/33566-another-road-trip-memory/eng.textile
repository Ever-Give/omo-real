Jane was with me in the car for a long trip on the motorway. we were between rest stops when she suddenly announced she needed to pee urgently. We did the usual "Can you hold it"

"no I can't" thing and i could see she was getting panicky. We had been together long enough for her to know that I wore a diaper for trips and said she wished she had taken precautions herself. I remembered that i carried a "spare" Tena slip in the car and said she could get it out of the glove box.

Jane asked what to do and I suggested she opened it out and slipped it under her bum on the seat and then dropped her pants and pulled the front of the diaper up between her legs before "letting go". After fumbling about a bit she got everything in position and said "like this". I told her it looked good but to be sure to hold the front of the diaper up fairly high.

I heard -or perhaps imagined that I heard - the whoosh of her urgently emptying bladder and looked across to see the yellow stain spread across the padding of the diaper.

Jane was breathing sighs of relief and I asked if she was OK. I also commented that she had not pulled her panties down. I learned something about her that day because she grinned and said "I never do if they are wet already".
