I know it sounds strange, but did anyone else noticed how a presence of a toilet bowl or urinal has a strange affect on people when they're really desperate to pee? It's actually funny, but when you're desperate and standing in front of a toilet bowl and you're seconds away from the moment when you can pee, it's really hard to hold it until you undo your pants or put paper on the toilet seat? It's like a brain would intentionally mess with you and release the brakes on the bladder at that point and you have to hurry to get your pants down fast enough before urine comes out.

It's the same when you're waiting in front of the bathroom in a line. If I walk and looking for a bathroom I can hold it much longer than when standing in front of an occupied bathroom for my turn to use it. Or when you come home and you're really desperate and only moments away from the toilet and while unlocking the apartment door or getting out of the car on the parking lot you get extra strong urge to pee. At least for me, that usually ends up with a few spurts of pee in my panties if not worse.
