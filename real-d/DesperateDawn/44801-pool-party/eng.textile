I'm looking forward to this evening.

At first I was dreading it, because my friends have a pool but refuse to get a heater so it is fucking freezing. But now I am starting to see the positives of it, being that we'll all be drinking a lot of alcohol which increases need like no other, and water pressure is great for desperate bladders. And because the pool is so cold, once everyone has adjusted to the water temperature they won't want to get out again. Very much looking forward to watching the subtle squirms as my friends try to hide their desperation... I'll be desperate too, but my bladder of steel can cope without wiggles... I hope.
