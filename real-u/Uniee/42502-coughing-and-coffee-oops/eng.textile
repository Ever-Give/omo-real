This week I've had a few days off and have been waking up pretty desperate (usually posting about it on live thread)...

Went out last night and had a few cocktails ? ..

Well this morning I woke with a very full bladder , so did the obvious.... lay in bed drinking water ?...

Finally I decided it was time to get up... squirming. In my house we do have a bathroom next to kitchen so I made my way there, legs crossed, pee dancing.

Now in the morning I love my coffee so thought I'd fill up the coffee pot to brew whilst I was having a wee... as you can imagine turning the tap was very difficult had to hand hold but made it dry.. so I started up the coffee pot.. and there's where the problem came I started coughing and my bladder gave out. I was stood in kitchen peeing full force into my pjs, now way of stopping it... I emptied my full morning wee into my pjs and made a huge puddle. Took nearly half a kitchen roll to mop up!

Luckily I was home alone so I threw my pjs in the wash and am now back in bed, with my coffee ?

Wouldn't have risked downstairs toilet if anyone had been in.. due to squirmy pee dance..

Nice , not like you to go from no leak to full blown wet and unable to stop must have been thrilling

I was squirmy desperate but the coughing caused me to relax....
