Hey everyone!

I had a nice dinner out, and ended up drinking quite a bit of iced tea.. On my drive home, I noticed an urge building in my bladder..

I decided to go in my jeans, instead of holding on for the toilet.. After letting out about five spurts of pee, the urge to fully empty my bladder down my legs was overwhelming..

So, I stood in the kitchen and peed my pants
