It's been a while since my last post, so i thought i would share my training from today!

I'm a triathlete, so i do a lot of swimming in wetsuit, and a allways make sure to "preheat" it with pee before my training session

But today was a bit different, because it so hot outside in Denmark, i made sure do be well hydratet before my workout. When i left from work i could feel the urge to pee, but i thought i would wait.

When i arrived at the beach, i put on my swimsuit as normal and went in to the water - today there was a lot bathing guests so i found a spot where there wasn't anyone nearby and then let go. It felt amazing, i could feel the warm pee down my legs and up my back - and looking on all the guests not knowing what happened in my swimsuit made it even better.
