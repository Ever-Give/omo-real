Losing control at the back door

Hey folks!

Yesterday, I drank two mugs of tea and a 12 oz glass of water before going on a walk. Even having peed beforehand I was bursting in the last mile. There was no place to relieve myself outdoors since it was late in the afternoon and still quite light outside. As I crossed the large field by my apt, I decided to sneak down the back alley and go through my backdoor, just in case I had to let some go.

Sure enough, upon unlocking the dead bolt and door knob I turned the knob only to realize that I hadn't actually unlocked in completely. This made my bladder twinge with urgency as I tried to unlock the knob again. This was one of two doors I needed to unlock before getting into my apt, as I have a small mudroom off the back. At this point I seriously contemplated just letting it go there, since there is vinyl flooring. However, I have some AC units on the floor that I didn't want to soak- I knew I'd make a massive puddle.

As I unlocked the door to my kitchen I just felt like I HAD to let go. As I kicked off my shoes and ran to the bathroom I couldn't stop spurting before finally reaching the toilet and unleashing a powerful torrent of pee.

This is the first time in a while that I felt like I would lose complete control. Tea never fails to push my bladder to the edge!
