Another time I was in 3rd grade we had to do the presidential fitness test. I ducking hate that shit. So I decided to piss myself out of desperation. So I ran my mile my bladder wanting to give in but not letting it. Btw I was a handsome kid wearing a tshirt and wearing light grey pants which would be easily noticed by anyone if I pissed. So after running the mile we got a bathroom break which I did not use. Then it was lunch and I was pretending to be mute after being so tired of the run. Then I didn't piss of desperation but of laughter. So my friends tried to make me laugh which succeeded and every time I laughed a stream came out for 1 sec. at the end of lunch o gave up the mute and laughed so hard the rest of the piss came out. That was the end
