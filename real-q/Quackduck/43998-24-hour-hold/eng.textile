I’m going to attempt a 24 Hour Hold. Starting at 9:00 tonight, I will try to retain my urine until 9:00 tomorrow. I have to be at a few classes tomorrow, but after 5:00 I think Ill have the whole day to myself, so long as nothing unplanned happens. I’ll keep you updated.

I unfortunately felt the need to defecate around 1:30 pm, so I cut the challenge short as that is a huge turnoff for me. I'll try it again another time, maybe Thursday?

I successfully skipped my morning pee, which I honestly thought was going to be more difficult than it was. All throughout the day, I only had a dull ache in my bladder, and I was really surprised at how much urine I was holding once I finally peed. It definitely didn't feel like much. Nearing 1:00, it was a little uncomfortable to lean forward, but nothing too much. I'll keep you updated later this week when I try again.

Did you drink water normally that day or did you cut down a little?

Excited to hear about your 2nd try!

I once went about 16 hours without peeing on a really long bus ride (despite there being a toilet on the bus so I could have had I wanted to), and didn‘t even need to very much towards the end so I figure I could do 24 hours if I really tried... but I‘ve also always struggled with drinking enough water, so I don‘t think that was healthy

I cut down a little, but next time i wont. I’m also going to stop drinking a little earlier, maybe 6:00 pm.
