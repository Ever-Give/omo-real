If you had to choose, would you want a big bladder or a small bladder?

Small bladder would make you need to pee more often, but with less at once.

Large bladder would mean less need to pee, but when you need to, it would be a lot.

I personally like have a large bladder and enjoy that I could soak my entire couch with just one go.

My friend who is into this has a small bladder and prefers getting to pee more.

So, what's your preferred size and what size do you have?
