Sure did. At first I stopped after a few seconds, but then I thought what the hell, sofas wet now anyway so I let the rest out. I was kind of half lying half sitting (slouching?) and feeling the warmth pooling under my ass and back as I peed for a solid 60 seconds was an almost spiritual experience. Especially after holding it for almost three hours by that point.

Sofa scrubbed up nice in the end. Covers are washable and the cushions rinsed off, so no harm no foul.

More spur off the moment "wouldn't it be fun if...?" kind of thing. The more I thought about it, the more the sheer naughtiness of it was too much to say no to.
