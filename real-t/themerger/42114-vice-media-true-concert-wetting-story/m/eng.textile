I found this to be an entertaining read: The story is told by a one young man who 'emancipates' himself from his bladder, in the name of enjoying one of his favorite bands. I can certainly relate, having watched and played numerous concerts with a bursting bladder! I may follow Zachary's lead next time.

Enjoy!
