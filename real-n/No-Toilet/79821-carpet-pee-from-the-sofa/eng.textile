There are some advantages of having NO TOILET in one's apartment such as not needing to stop what I am doing to go to the lavatory when my bladder is full. Such as here where I was sitting on the sofa wearing only a t-shirt watching TV when I became desperate for a wee but without any facilities to relieve myself I simply shuffled to the edge of the seat and urinated onto the carpet below not missing the show!

TV volume was muted.
