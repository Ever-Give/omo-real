Hi everyone!

So, last night was the first time I have wet a pair of jeans this season.. It definitely won't be the last

Before my trip home, I was pretty desperate.. I decided to sit on top of a trash bag and and play a little game a good friend of mine on here and I came up with called Stop light pee..

The premise of the game is once you're stopped at a red light, you have to push a spurt of pee in your pants.. I modified the rules a little, and at every traffic signal, 8 in total, I spurted in my pants.

There was a sizeable wet patch, down to about mid thigh once I got home on my jeans, slowly creeping down to my butt..

Still quite desperate, I made my way out to into the middle of my street (I live in a rural area) and totally unloaded the contents of my bladder with one large push, pee hissing into my jeans, quickly saturating them, and creating a puddle on the already wet pavement..

Mmmmmn, it felt so incredible! I just love the feeling of warm, wet denim sticking to my legs
