Last week I attempted to do a hold challenge while gaming.

I drank 2 bottles of water clicked start, 1 hour in I was still going strong with minor pressure building, however 2 hours in a small spurt came out causing a wet patch on the front of my boxers,

I thought it would be no big deal but 10 minutes later my bladder gave way completely soaking my underwear and wetting the towel I had placed under me at the beginning.

At least I won the match
