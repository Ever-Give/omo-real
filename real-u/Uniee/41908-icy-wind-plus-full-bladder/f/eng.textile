Didnt manage to get to bathroom from 7am to 4.30pm when I thought I’d just go when I got home. (I drink lots of water throughout day, plus a medium latte, 2 teas and an instant coffee)

The drive required occasional squeeze, but thought I could make it. Until the walk from the car... it’s freezing cold here, with an icy wind. A sudden blast hit me, and pee started flooding my knickers. To obvious to hold with hand so did a cross leg dip til I could stop flow (pretending to text)

Now sat in my soaked knickers (wet spot on trousers) having a little play with my still desperate self.. deciding if I should finish in my knickers or sensibly...

Didn’t have much choice but to finish in the end... poured out before I could even get to bathroom
