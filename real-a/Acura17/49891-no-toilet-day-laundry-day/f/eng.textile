Ya, so this happened today. I may have gone a little overboard. I enjoyed every second of it. Needed a "me" day.

Did you wet yourself today?

Nice- bet that felt great! I don't normally wet myself like that. I always have a full house. Maybe once every couple weeks can I sneak away long enough to enjoy it. This time, I had an empty house for the whole day, and a pile of laundry to do. I took FULL advantage of that situation. I do like diapers, but prefer wetting clothes. Plus the diapers I have aren't great.

What 's wrong with your diapers? Too small? Personally i like too small diapers as you can see them fill all the way up and leak a lil... Though the diapers i (sometimes) use hav e a huge capacity.

Ugh, I have store brand. They're just not comfortable, or stealthy, and leak too easily. I can't wear them out. I should spend the money on some good ones. What do you use?
